Upon review of the delegation paperwork for the injection it was noted that it did not track out and was incomplete, thus delegations could not be confirmed, examples include:

-Staff MS hired 8/26/15, had delegation paperwork signed by the nurse on 4/14/21, which MS had not signed. The next review of the delegation was signed by MS on 10/8/21, but the nurse signed off on the delegation as being completed on 10/6/21. It was noted that MS did not sign for P3's injection on 10/6/21, but did on 10/8/21. 

-Staff CH who was no longer an employee had delegation paperwork signed by CH, but not the nurse on 8/23/21 and 11/21/21. As the nurse never signed the paperwork, it was unclear if the delegation happened or if it needed to be rescinded. 

-Staff TS who no longer worked at the site, had delegation paperwork in P3's book indicating that TS was delegated on 10/1/21. TS did not sign on the MAR on 10/1/21, as completing the task of SQ injection for P3 on 10/1/21.

-Staff SS's (no hire date recorded) delegation paperwork was last signed on 10/4/21, staff SS did not sign on P3's MAR that day for administering the SQ injection. 

-Staff SB hired 8/11/21 had delegation paperwork indicating that they were delegated on 10/4/21 the same as staff SS. SB did not sign for P3's SQ injection on 10/4/21, so it could not be confirmed if the delegation review took place that day.

0375-Individual Support Plan: Req and Preperation OAR 411-325-0430 (1)-(6)
Based on staff interview and record review, it was determined that the program did not ensure documentation for the Individual Support Plan (ISP) was complete and accurate for one of two individuals reviewed. Findings include:

(2)(b) The Aspiration/Choking Protocol for P1 dated 3/22/19 was not accurate. The protocol indicated that oral hygiene would be completed for P1 30 minutes following any oral intake. S1 indicated the protocol was in error and that oral hygiene 30 minutes following any oral intake had been discontinued in February of 2019. S2 indicated they would update the protocol and remove that practice. 

(2)(b) The Dehydration Protocol for P1 dated 4/9/20 was not complete. The protocol indicated that a sign/symptom of dehydration in P1 was urinating less than usual. There was no baseline urine output/number of voids defined in order to alert staff to this sign/symptom of dehydration. 

(2)(b) The Constipation Protocol for P1 dated 4/9/20 was not complete and consistent with the Nursing Care Plan (NCP) dated 3/22/19. Examples include:
- The NCP indicated that P1 was cued to use the bathroom one time at night, but the protocol indicated P1 was cued to use the bathroom every two hours. S1 indicated that P1 was cued to use the restroom every two hours during awake hours and one time during the hours of sleep. S2 indicated the support documents would be updated to reflect the consistent current practice. 
- The NCP indicated that bowel movements were tracked on the Medication Administration Record (MAR), but the protocol indicated bowel movements were documented in Therap. S1 indicated that bowel movements are recorded in the MAR and then transferred to Therap intake and elimination. S2 indicated the support documents would be updated to reflect the consistent current practice. 
- The protocol indicated that a sign/symptom of constipation in P1 was, "" refusal to eat for [ fill in ] meals."" There was no amount of meals entered making it unclear how staff would be alerted to the identified sign/symptom of constipation. S2 indicated that was not a sign/symptom and would be removed from the protocol.

- The protocol indicated that a sign/symptom of dehydration in P2 was rapid weight loss. Weight tracking documentation in Therap indicated that from 12/2019-5/2020 weight was taken and recorded 1x monthly making it unclear how staff would be alerted to rapid weight loss in P2. 
- The protocol indicated that a sign/symptom of dehydration in P2 was urinating less than usual. There was no baseline urine output/number of voids indicated in the protocol and there was no consistent urine output/void tracking documentation found for P2 making it unclear how staff would be alerted to this sign/symptom of dehydration. 

The Fall Protocol for P2 dated 2/3/20 was not complete. The protocol indicated that as a preventative measure staff ""assist"" while in the community so P2 could be safe on uneven surfaces and steps. The protocol did not provide step by step directions on how staff were to provide that assistance. 
The Safety Plan for P2 dated 2/3/20 was not complete. Examples include: 
- For the risk of vehicle safety the plan indicated that P2 requires ""assistance"" to be safe in traffic and that staff would be in arms reach. The plan did not identify step by step instructions as to how staff were to provide that assistance to be safe in traffic. 

The Provider Risk Management Strategies (PRMS) was not complete for P3. Examples include: 
- The Safety Plan dated 4/13/20 and the Non-Edible Objects in Mouth Protocol dated 4/13/20 indicated that P3 was at risk of household chemical safety and that chemicals were locked. The risk of household chemical safety was not listed in the PRMS. S4 indicated that it was identified as a risk and the PRMS would be updated. 
- General Event Reports (GER's) for P3 dated 1/25/20, 1/28/20, 2/17/20, 2/22/20, and 2/23/20 indicated that P3 threw items at staff/housemates. The PRMS did not list the use of objects as weapons as a risk. S4 indicated that it was identified as a risk and the PRMS would be updated.

This restriction was not clearly identified in any support document, including instructions on what staff were to do if they went over 64 oz. of fluid in a day. Upon review of the electronic data base Therap, intake and elimination tracking, it was noted that there were times that P3 went over the limit and no action was clearly documented as taken.

The skin tracking form had the symbol ""F"" listed on all months reviewed 10/2019-1/2020. There was no corresponding key for what ""F"" represented. S4 indicated that the ""F"" represented fracture, which per medical records, it was noted P5's fracture was being treated.

(8)(b) P5's Individual Data Form (IDF) had not been updated as their orders changed, thus the IDF had inaccurate information examples include:

- P5 had an order for honey pureed consistency for all food dated 8/13/19, the IDF still listed dime size mechanical soft food.
-P5's IDF listed P5 as being on a 1600 calorie diet, this order had been discontinued on 11/18/19.

8)(b) P5's Dehydration Protocol dated 3/18/19 was incomplete/inaccurate. The protocol directs staff to monitor P5's fluid intake with an ounce parameter listed not cubic centimeters, which the program was actually tracking in. 

)(b) P5's Bowel Movements (BM) were not being accurately transcribed on to the electronic data base Therap. The program was recording P5's BMs on their paper Medication Administration Record (MAR) and in the electronic data base Therap. According to P5's Constipation Protocol dated 3/18/19 small BMs did not count. Indicating if P5 was only having small BMs then a PRN would be needed. It was also noted that the protocol indicated that BMs were just tracked in Therap. Upon review of Therap it was noted that there were times that P5 had only small BMs tracked, which would have triggered a PRN. However when reviewing P5's MAR it was noted that the BMs recorded on the MAR were not accurately corresponding to the Therap entry.

On  9/25/19, P5 only had a small BM according to Therap, which would have triggered a PRN. The MAR reflected a few BMs that day including BMs larger then small. 

On 7/24/19 Therap reflected P5 having no BMs, which would have triggered their PRN. According to the MAR P5 actually had an extra large BM that day.

(8)(b) Documentation for P4 was not accurate. P4's Individual Data Form (IDF) in Therap and the Individual Summary Sheet had not been updated as P4's physician orders changed, thus the IDF and Individual Summary Sheet had inaccurate information. Examples include: 

- The aspiration/choking evaluation from the speech and language pathologist (SLP) on 1/1/2020 indicated that P4's fluid recommendation was nectar thick and food texture was pureed pudding texture/no clumps. Information listed on the IDF and Individual Summary Sheet continued to indicate honey thick fluid and honey thick puree with a sip of thin liquids in between 2-3 bites of pureed food.

- The IDF and Individual Summary Sheet indicated that P4 had a 1200 calorie daily diet, but a physician order dated 11/22/19 discontinued the daily calorie count diet.

- The plan indicated that P4 was at risk of vehicle safety and staff would be present to assist P4 with all transfers, but the strategy did not define the steps staff would take in order to provide that assistance. 
- The plan indicated that P4 did not have stranger awareness and staff were supposed to follow all support documents and protocols to mitigate the risk. There was no documentation found in P4's support documents and protocols that directed staff how to support P4 specifically for the risk of not having stranger awareness

2)(b) The Skin Integrity Protocol for P4 dated 6/5/19 was not accurate. As a preventative measure the protocol indicated that staff would check P4's finger nails and then file and documentation would be recorded as a PRN on P4's Medication Administration Record (MAR). There was no documentation found on P4's MARs from 8/2019-1/23/2020 to indicate this practice was occurring

2)(b) The Aspiration/Choking Protocol for P4 dated 6/5/19 and Dining Plan dated 6/2015 were not updated to reflect an evaluation for aspiration and choking completed on 1/1/2020 by the speech and language pathologist (SLP) during a hospital stay from 12/29/19-1/1/2020. The evaluation from the SLP on 1/1/2020 indicated that P4's fluid recommendation was nectar thick and food texture was pureed pudding texture/no clumps. These instructions were not updated on P4's Aspiration/Choking Protocol and Dining Plan as instructions continued to indicate honey thick fluid and honey thick puree with a sip of thin liquids in between 2-3 bites of pureed food. It should be noted there were no recorded incidents of aspiration/choking for P4 since the 1/1/2020 change in food and fluid texture was recommended (t-logs and General Event Reports reviewed from 1/1/2020-1/23/2020). S4 and S5  indicated that thin liquids had not been implemented and must have been an error in the SLP evaluation dated 3/12/19 that was transferred onto the 6/5/19 Aspiration/Choking Protocol and 6/2015 Dining Plan

(2)(b) The Constipation Protocol for P4 dated 6/5/19 was not accurate. As a preventative measure the protocol indicated P4 would receive bran one time daily. There was no documentation found to indicate this practice was occurring. S4 indicated that the protocol was in error as P4 did not receive bran one time daily. 

2)(b) The Seizure Protocol for P4 dated 6/5/19 was not accurate. The protocol indicated that as a preventative measure P4 would have the seatbelt strap fastened with a safety cap on while in the wheelchair. There was an ISP Change form for P4 dated 10/28/19 that indicated the seatbelt cover/cap had been discontinued. S2 indicated the protocol would be updated to remove the seatbelt cover/cap. 

(1)(c) It could not be determined if all known risks were communicated for P5. P5's Nursing Care Plan dated 3/18/19 and 180-day orders dated 10/30/19 indicated that if P5 has a seizure 911 is to be called. Seizures is not identified on P5's Risk Identification Tool dated 2/19/19 as a risk; including whether it is a historical risk or not. It was noted that P5 takes the psychotropic medication Depakote, which can also be used to treat seizures. 

(2)(b) P5's Financial Plan dated 3/18/19 was incomplete and inaccurate. Examples include:

-The plan indicated that P5's room and board was $1300 a month. There was no explanation as to why it was much higher then the maximum $608.00 mandated by the state and SSI.

- The math of expenses to income was inaccurate and did not match up. The expense column indicated that P5 spent $1300 on room and board and $300 on medication. However the plan indicates that P5's SSA income was $1392 there was no additional income listed. It would be impossible for P5 to spend $1600 a month, but only receive $1392 in income.  

(2)(c) P5's Provider Risk Management Strategy (PRMS) was not updated when support documents changed. Examples include:

- P5's PRMS listed P5's Aspiration Protocol as being dated 3/18/19. The Aspiration Protocol found for P5 was dated 8/13/19. 
-P5's PRMS listed P5's Positive Behavior Support Plan as being dated 3/18/19, the one found was dated 3/5/19. 

Both were confirmed as the accurate support documents

The VNS Protocol for P4 dated 6/5/19 indicated that in the event that P4 experienced a seizure after 30 seconds the VNS was to be swiped with the magnet and again every 30 seconds and repeated three times. There was no physician's order found for this treatment. 

(2)(b)(C)(c) Physician orders for P4 were not clear and not implemented. P4 had a physician order dated 4/10/19 and 12/29/19 with heart failure instructions to weigh P4 daily as fluid retention is the first sign the heart is worse and report a weight gain of 2-3 lbs in a 24 hour period or weight gain of 4-5 lbs in a week and notify P4's physician. However, a physician's order dated 1/9/19 from the primary care physician (PCP) indicated weekly weights were discontinued and prescribed P4's weight to be taken one time monthly. S4 indicated because P4's weight had become stable that the PCP indicated that weights could be taken monthly. It was unclear if the heart failure instructions from the physician were still active. It should be noted that the orders on 4/10/19 and 12/29/19 continued to be reflected in P4's Cardiac Protocol dated 6/5/19. Vital sign documentation and documentation on P4's Medication Administration Record (MAR) from 8/2019-1/23/2020 did not reflect P4's weights were taken daily.

- The record listed a Panasonic stereo, but did not indicate the corresponding identification number.
- P4 had a Element television in P4's bedroom with a corresponding purchase receipt dated 12/20/19. This item was not added to the record. 

It should be noted that S3 and S4 updated the Property Record during this inspection to reflect the identification number of the stereo and entered the television into the record.

(1) An item identified on P5's Personal Property Record could not be located on the day of the review. The record indicated that P5 had a """"snow flake fleece comforter"". This was not located on the day of the review. It was observed that P5 did have fleece snowflake sheets on the their bed.

(2)(a) P5's Personal Property Record did not have complete descriptions/brand names of all items. Examples include but are not limited to: head board and bed size, DVD player name brand, description of sketchers, lift recliner description, and dresser description.

As a preventative measure the protocol indicated that staff would check P4's finger nails and then file and documentation would be recorded as a PRN on P4's Medication Administration Record (MAR). There was no documentation found on P4's MARs from 8/2019-1/23/2020 to indicate this practice was occurring

(1)(n) The Aspiration/Choking Protocol for P4 dated 6/5/19 and Dining Plan dated 6/2015 were not updated to reflect an evaluation for aspiration and choking completed on 1/1/2020 by the speech and language pathologist (SLP) during a hospital stay from 12/29/19-1/1/2020. The evaluation from the SLP on 1/1/2020 indicated that P4's fluid recommendation was nectar thick and food texture was pureed pudding texture/no clumps. These instructions were not updated on P4's Aspiration/Choking Protocol and Dining Plan as instructions continued to indicate honey thick fluid and honey thick puree with a sip of thin liquids in between 2-3 bites of pureed food. It should be noted there were no recorded incidents of aspiration/choking for P4 since the 1/1/2020 change in food and fluid texture was recommended (t-logs and General Event Reports reviewed from 1/1/2020-1/23/2020). S4 and S5 indicated that thin liquids had not been implemented and must have been an error in the SLP evaluation dated 3/12/19 that was transferred onto the 6/5/19 Aspiration/Choking Protocol and 6/2015 Dining Plan

1)(n)  P5 was not receiving adequate support for their risk of aspiration. Upon review of P5's aspiration physician orders from their last Dysphasia Evaluation dated 8/13/19, it was noted that they were not reflected on P5's Aspiration Protocol dated 8/13/19 and Dinning Plan dated 6/15/15. Nor were the orders observed to be put into action. Examples include:

- The evaluation stated that all of P5's food was to be pureed. The puree texture was not identified on the evaluation. The Aspiration Protocol just stated that food was to be pureed, and not the consistency of the puree, and referred staff to a swallow evaluation dated 4/25/17 (that was not located on the day of the review) and P5's Dining Plan dated 6/15/15. Upon review of the Dining Plan it was noted that the plan did not identity pureed food, but that P5's food texture modification was dime size mechanical soft. This information conflicted; it was noted during the opening questions at the start of the review S3 stated that P5's food texture was honey thick puree. 

When the nurse (S2) was asked about P5's food consistency; the nurse stated P5 was on a honey thick puree. However, when S4 was asked (the staff member that works on the floor, and who would actually make P5's food) was asked he/she stated oatmeal thick consistency. A clarification to the physician order for P5's pureed food consistency was found in P5's medical record dated 11/18/19, this order called for a honey thick puree. There was also a clarification order from the speech therapist dated 8/13/19 for honey thick found in P5's medical record.  This was never added to any support document found on the day of the review. 

- P5's Aspiration Protocol did not reflect P5's current fluid order. The protocol indicates that P5 was to receive 2 oz. of fluid at a time. The 11/18/19 physician clarification order states 1 oz. at a time not 2 oz. When this reviewer observed P5 being fed liquids it appeared to be more then 1 oz. at a time. It was also observed that the staff kept P5 continually drinking the 720 cc provided in a short period of time. It was noted that P5's Dinning Plan does indicate that staff is to keep P5 on task while eating/drinking with verbal cues according to the Dinning Plan. However, it was unclear why P5 would be given so much fluid in one sitting and just encouraged to rapidly drink the fluid. At times staff were seen physically assisting P5, which was not clear in the swallow evaluation orders or Aspiration Protocol that physical assistance to consume fluid in a short amount of time was required. The swallow evaluation did indicate that P5 has trouble swallowing, and pacing their intake and should not be fed rapidly.  

-P5's Dysphasia Evaluation and Aspiration Protocol both indicate that P5's head of bed was to be kept at a 30 degree angle. Upon observing P5's head of bed it was noted that the bed appeared much higher then 30 degrees. S1 used a protractor to measure the head of bed to 30 degrees and marked the angle on P5's head board. When the reviewer went to confirm the angle it was observed to be a at a 30 degree angle. However, it was noted that the old marking was still in place along with the new marking. Staff were informed of this by the reviewer during the exit meeting. Indicating that staff may not know what mark to follow.

- It was also noted that P5's Individual Data Form had not been updated with the pureed consistency for all food, and still listed dime size mechanical soft food. 

- It was noted that no change form was found for when the Aspiration Protocol was updated on 8/13/19.

1)(n) P5 was not receiving adequate support for their risk of unreported pain and repositioning. According to a 6/10/19 General Event Report (GER) P5 may have received a fracture while being repositioned when their brief was being changed. The GER indicated that staff had repositioned P5 up to change them and heard a pop. Staff called in a second staff and it was decided that 911 should be called. P5 was transported to the Emergency Room. At that time the physician took no x-rays and sent P5 home. Later while graveyard was changing P5 it was discover that her/his leg was swollen. 911 was called again; and at the second ER visit the physician ordered x-rays and it was discovered that P5 had a fracture. 

Following this event a clear documented training was not done regarding repositioning as repositioning incorrectly could have been a reason for the fracture. Nor was any support document found regarding directions on how to reposition P5. The only protocol found addressing repositioning for P5 was the Unreported Pain Protocol dated 3/18/19. This protocol directed staff to reposition P5 with pillows, but did not indicate what that would look like. The repositioning chart listed nothing regarding pillows. 

Furthermore, it was noted that the ER discharge paperwork from this incident dated 6/11/19, indicated that P5 appeared to have a broken rib that was 3-5 weeks old. There was no documentation found that the broken rib was ever discovered by staff nor was documentation found that P5 was in pain as a result of the broken rib. 

Due to P5's high risk of fracture due to osteoporosis, and skin integrity due to complete assistance with transfers and changes it could not be determined if P5 was receiving adequate supports; based on the 6/10/19 GER that indicated staff may have repositioned P5 to quickly, resulting in a potential fracture, and no clear follow-up regarding being gentle with transferring. Nor could it be determined if the unreported pain protocol was sufficient as the program did not realize P5 had a broken rib for 3-5 weeks until it was discovered at the ER following another injury.

According to P5's Positive Behavior Support Plan dated 3/5/19, when P5 is engaging in Self-injurious Behavior a glove is to be placed on their hand to prevent skin damage. There was no IBL in place addressing this safeguarding intervention.

The protocol indicated that a sign/symptom of dehydration in P5 would be a fluid intake of less than 66 ounces (the program tracks fluid in Therap as milliliters (ml) and the Google conversion is 1951.85 ml = 66 ounces) in one day. The protocol instructs that if signs/symptoms of dehydration are observed in P5 then the program manager (PM) and physician were to be notified for further instructions, as well as a General Event Report (Incident Report) was to be completed. A review of fluid tracking on Therap for P5, T-logs on Therap, and General Event Reports (GERs) from 8/2019-2/2020 indicated that P5 had experienced a fluid intake of less than 66 ounces (1951.85 ml) and there was no follow-up action taken (PM/physician notification and GER completed). 

The Unreported Pain Protocol for P5 dated 7/9/19 was not implemented. The protocol indicated that as a preventative measure for this risk a skin check would be completed during P1's showers. A review of P5's Medication Administration Record (MAR) and skin/wound tracking in Therap from 8/2019-2/2020 indicated that skin checks were only completed 17 times. It was unclear how staff would be alerted to a wound when skin checks were not completed consistently

The Dehydration Protocol for P2 was not followed. P2's Dehydration Protocol, dated  03/20/2019, indicated that a sign/symptom of dehydration would be a fluid intake of less than 1833 ounces (the program tracks fluid in Therap as milliliters (ml) and the Google conversion is 1833 ml = 62 ounces) in one day. The protocol states if signs/symptoms of dehydration are observed in P2, then the program manager (PM) and physician were to be notified for further instructions, as well as a General Event Report (Incident Report) was to be completed. A review of fluid tracking in Therap, P2's T-logs in Therap, and General Event Reports (GERs) from 7/2019-2/2020 indicated that P2 had experienced a fluid intake of less than 62 ounces (1833 ml) and there was no follow-up action taken (PM/physician notification and GER completed).

Based on record review, it was determined that the program did not ensure documentation for the Individual Support Plan (ISP) was complete and accurate for two of two individuals reviewed. Findings include:

(2)(b) The Safety Plan for P1 dated 3/16/20 was not complete. Examples include: 
- The plan indicated that staff assist P1 in opening the gate. The plan did not describe how staff were to provide this assistance. 
- The plan indicated P1 was at risk for significant exploitation and to follow all supports and approved protocols, but there were no support documents that indicated how staff were to respond in the event P1 was being exploited. 

(2)(b) The Dehydration Protocol for P1 dated 2/20/20 was unclear. The protocol indicated that signs/symptoms of dehydration were rapid weight loss and urinating less than usual. There were no instructions as to have staff would be alerted to these signs/symptoms because weight tracking per Medication Administration Records (MARs) reviewed from 9/2020-2/2021 were completed weekly and there was no void tracking found. 

(2)(b) The Safety Plan for P2 dated 11/13/20 was not complete. The plan indicated that for the risk of significant exploitation staff would always be with P2 at all times in the community but did not indicate how staff were to respond in the event P2 was being exploited.

Fluid intake documentation was zero for fluid intake 5/20-5/24/21 and there was no corresponding documentation found to indicate the physician and nurse were notified per the protocol. 

(2)(a)(C) It was unclear based on documentation found for P2 if P2's risk of constipation was being monitored in order to take action in a timely manner to identified changes or conditions that might lead to deterioration or harm. Examples include: 
- The Constipation Protocol for P2 dated 11/27/19 and 5/18/21 was not accurate. The protocol indicated that P2's bowel movements (BMs) were self reported and documented in Therap. The protocol did not indicate in what module in Therap staff were to consistently document BMs. There was completed bowel tracking found attached to P2's Medication Administration Records (MARs) for February and March 2021 but the bowel tracking documentation did not have a corresponding month or name of individual on the documents making it unclear if it was P2's bowel tracking and what month the documents were for. Additionally, there was no bowel tracking found in Therap for P2 and no bowel tracking found from April-June 2021 for P2 making it unclear if P2's risk of constipation was being monitored. 
- The Constipation Protocols indicated to administer P2's PRN medication for signs/symptoms of constipation. There was no PRN found for constipation found on P2's Medication Administration Records (MARs) reviewed from March-June 2021.

When reviewing the ledger the program was maintaining it was noted that the ending balance (eb) was above $2,000, even when subtracting the stimulus payments of $2,000 the countable balance was still consistently above the $2000 limit.

It is to be noted that the program made $5470 in furniture and bedding purchases on 1/23/22, which put P2's resources within the countable resource limit.

- The Financial Plan dated 12/13/21 for P2 indicated that purchases over $300 required ISP team approval. There is no documentation of ISP team approval for purchases that totaled $5470.00 for furniture and bedding on 1/23/22.

- The program did not keep accurate records of P2's cash on hand. The February 2022 cash on hand ledger indicated that P2's cash balance was $15.28.  P2's actual cash on hand balance was $15.53. 

- P2's ledger was inaccurate. The ledger indicated the balance on 12/9/21 was $3.28 plus the $12.20 returned change was equal to $15.28.  The accurate result is $3.28 + $12.20 = $15.48.

-The plan indicated that ISP team approval is required for purchases over $300. The program did not provide ISP documentation of ISP team approval for a purchase of $5470 for bedroom furniture at Banner Furniture on 1/23/22.

(2)(c) P5's physician order dated 3/1/17 for weekly weights was not implemented as written. The order instructed that P5's weight was to be taken weekly and to notify the nurse and program manager if there was a weight difference of 5 lbs and reweigh P5 the next morning. The Medication Administration Record (MAR), weight tracking in Therap, and t-logs in Therap indicated that P5 experienced a weight difference of more than 5 lbs in a week and there was no documentation to indicate that the nurse and program manager were notified, nor was there documentation of P5's weight taken the next morning. Examples include (2019): 
- 9/12 148.8 lbs and on 9/19 141.1 lbs which was a decrease of over 5 lbs.

It should be noted that P4 was being weighed weekly per the MAR and vitals from 8/2019-1/8/2020 (there was no noted weight gain of 4-5 lbs in 1 week) and then monthly starting 1/9/2020.

(2)(a)(C) It was unclear if P4's Ventricular Nerve Stimulator (VNS) Protocol dated 6/5/19 was being implemented as written. The protocol indicated that in the event that P4 experienced a seizure, after 30 seconds the VNS was to be swiped with the magnet and again every 30 seconds and repeated three times. Additionally, the protocol indicated that seizures would be tracked in the seizure record for P4. A review of seizure tracking in Therap and on paper seizure records from 8/2019-1/23/2020 indicated that P4 experienced seizure activity and the VNS was swiped with the magnet, but it was unclear if the VNS was swiped every 30 seconds initially and then repeated three times every 30 seconds per the protocol. Seizure/VNS documentation listed the VNS was used via check mark or number of times on the tracking. Examples include: 
- 11/16/19 P4 experienced a seizure for 1 minute and there was a corresponding ""x1"" entry made next to the VNS intervention on the record. 
- 11/16/19 P4 experienced a seizure for 5 minutes and there was a corresponding check mark entry made next to the VNS intervention on the record. 
- 1/17/2020 P4 experienced a seizure for 1 minute and there was a corresponding ""x2"" entry made next to the VNS intervention on the record. 
- 1/20/2020 P4 experienced a seizure for 30 seconds and there was no corresponding entry made next to the VNS intervention on the record.

(2)(a)(C) P4's Dehydration Protocol dated 6/5/19 was not implemented. The protocol indicated that a sign/symptom of dehydration in P4 would be a fluid intake of less than 32 ounces (tracked in ccs on fluid tracking, 32 oz = 946.353 cc) according to the conversion table on Google) in one day. Additionally, the protocol instructed that if signs/symptoms of dehydration were observed in P4 then the supervisor and nurse were to be notified for instructions and a General Event Report (Incident Report) was to be completed. A review of fluid tracking in Therap and General Event Reports for P4 from 8/2019-1/23/2020 indicated P4 had a fluid intake of less than 32 ounces in one day and there was no corresponding documentation found that the supervisor and nurse were notified for instructions and there was no General Event Report completed. Examples include: 
- 8/3/19 zero cc

(2)(a)(C) The Constipation Protocol for P4 dated 6/5/19 was not implemented. The protocol indicated that a sign/symptom of constipation in P4 was refusal to eat two meals. Meal tracking in Therap from 8/2019-1/23/2020 indicated P4 missed/refused 2 meals and there was no documented follow-up action taken to address this sign/symptom of constipation. Examples include: 
- 8/3/19 zero meals eaten
- 8/17/19 zero meals eaten
- 8/22/19 zero meals eaten
- 8/23/19 zero meals eaten
- 8/24/19 zero meals eaten

(2)(a)(C) Post Sedation Monitoring could not be located for P5 as outlined in their Sedation Protocol dated 3/18/19. P5 had dental work under sedation on 2/7/19. A record of staff monitoring P5 post sedation was not found for this dental appointment. 
2)(a)(C) P5 was not being monitored for dehydration as outlined in their Dehydration Protocol dated 3/18/19. P5's protocol directed staff to contact the nurse and supervisor if he/she was under 64 oz. of fluid in a day. There were several days that P5 was under 64 oz. of fluid in a day and there was no documentation found that the nurse and supervisor were notified. This reviewer asked S2 if he/she had ever been notified of P5 being below 64 oz. of fluid in a day. S2 confirmed that they could not recall being notified for P5 being under their fluid parameter. (The program was tracking P5's fluids in cc not oz the conversion according to Google is 1892.7 cc to oz) Examples of days P5 was below 1892 cc and no documentation of notification could be located include in the time frame reviewed 9/1/19-1/22/20:

(2)(a)(C) P5's weights were not being monitored as identified on their Medication Administration Record (MAR). The MAR directs staff to call the nurse if P5 has a +/- 5 lb. difference in a week. It was noted that in 6/2019 P5's weight fluctuated and there was no documentation that the nurse was informed. 

P5's weights were:

It was unclear if the unit of measurement was accurate as the goal per physician orders was 32 ounces and not 32 milliliters which equals only 1.08 ounces of fluid.

Provider completes progress notes on an electronic system known as Therap, and records are stored and signed electronically. Staff are documenting the events of each shift with great detail, and it is clear the plans of service are being implemented in the home. Auditor observed the Home Manager reviews and approves daily progress notes within the electronic system, and staff can flag notes with important information for review by other staff. Auditor noted staff are completing progress notes on every shift for all Consumers reviewed. Auditor has concerns with 24 hours of staffing not being documented within progress notes for several instances. There are many instances of 30 minutes - 1 hour of time missing within progress notes. For example, Auditor observed frequent 8:30am - 9:00am timeframes not being documented for Consumers A and B. Provider explained there are staff in the home to provide assistance to these consumers, as needed. Provider stated the codes that are billed for services provided are ""Per Diem""; therefore, there was
an assumption not all 24 hours of care needed to be documented. Auditor explained that while staff may not be providing a direct
service 24 hours of the day such as personal care or community living supports, there should still be documentation available to
show staff are available and are observing the consumers, as needed. RECOMMENDATIONS: Provider is to ensure staff are including the correct timeframes within progress notes in order to capture the times staff are available to provide direct care to consumers in the home. Provider is being paid on a Per Diem basis, which means payment covers 24 hours of the day. Therefore, documentation of services provided should reflect a 24 hour timeframe that is broken down between two to three shifts within the day. Provider is encouraged to contact the SCCMHA Contract Department if clarification is needed regarding documentation standards per their contract."

Surveyor: 42003
Based on document review and interview, the facility failed to include a communication plan in the Emergency Preparedness Plan (EPP). This was evidenced by missing critical contact information, written plans for primary and alternate means of communication, delegation of a public information officer, and missing written plans for communicating with family members, sister facilities, and emergency officials. This could result in the facility being unprepared during an emergency. This affected six of six clients. 
Findings:
During document review and interview with Program Manager (PM) on 2/14/22 the communication plan was reviewed.

During a review of the facility's Incident Report dated 1/8/21, it indicated Client A was found to have a bruise forming on her left shoulder on 
1/8/21 at ""approximately"" 1 :45 p.m. The qualified intellectual disabilities professional (QIDP) documented he drove to the facility and spoke with RN 1 (via computer tablet - face-time). The QIDP documented Client A's left shoulder had a light purple bruise and her shoulder ""was swollen an appeared slightly displaced."" During an interview on 1/13/21 at 12 noon, the QIDP stated he was doing an investigation (into what caused Client A's injuries). He stated multiple staff had handled Client A that morning (1/8/21 ). He stated Client A had limited speech, but could answer yes/no questions. He stated he came in to investigate the incident on 1/8/21 and discussed Client A's status with RN 1 via computer tablet (face time). The QIDP stated Client A's left shoulder looked ""displaced"" and she had a dark purple bruise right below her shoulder joint. He stated he showed RN 1 the client's injuries and the decision was made to send Client A to urgent care for further follow-up. During a review of the acute hospital's Emergency Physician Notes dated 1/8/21 at 7:01 p.m., the notes indicated: Client A had a hematoma (pool of clotted blood formed in an area of the body) of her left shoulder; she was in mild distress; she was speaking in full sentences; she had a left clavicle (collarbone) fracture; left humerus (bone of the upper arm) fracture; and a left upper extremity contusion (bruise). During an interview with the QIDP on 1/13/21 at 12:05 p.m., the QIDP stated Direct Support Professional (DSP) 1 worked the night shift and had assisted Client A to the restroom at 4 a.m. The QIDP stated at that time, per DSP 1, Client A did not have any problems assisting with toileting, by using the grab bar in the restroom. He stated that when DSP 1 went to return Client A to her bed after toileting, Client A was resistive and did not want to go back to bed. The QIDP stated DSP 1 allowed Client A to lay on the floor (on a large pillow next to bed). He stated when DSP 2 and DSP 3 arrived for the day shift, they saw Client A asleep on the floor pillow. The QIDP stated the DSPs did not notice any bruises on Client A at that time. The QIDP stated at 8 a.m., when DSP 2 and DSP 3 went to get Client A up for toileting, DSP 3 reported Client A would not assist (by grabbing the grab bar in the restroom), but stated that was not unusual due to Client A's behavior of refusals (resistiveness). He stated the same staff brought Client A to the table for breakfast, but again she refused to eat, (not unusual) so staff fed her. The QIDP stated Client A had behaviors of screaming and yelling due to her declining mental status, which she usually did. DSP 2 and DSP 3 reported checking on Client A's status throughout the day and contacted the program manager (PM) at 1 :30 
p.m., when they observed a bruise (forming on her left shoulder area). During an interview with the QIDP on 10/13/21 at 1 p.m., he stated RN 1 did not accompany him to the facility to assess Client A when her initial injury was observed (on 1/8/21 at approximately 1 :30 p.m.). He stated an RN did not come to the facility to assess Client A, but stated RN 1 did assess Client A via use of the computer tablet. The QIDP stated after seeing Client A's injuries via computer tablet, she stated Client A needed to be transported to Urgent Care for further evaluation. The QIDP stated DSP 2 was directed to transport Client A to Urgent Care. When asked if anyone stabilized Client A's arm prior to transport to Urgent Care, the QIDP stated Client A's arm was not stabilized. The QIDP stated DSP 2 took Client A, (in her wheelchair), to Urgent Care in the facility's van. He stated Client A was still moving her arm a little. He stated he was not aware of any fracture until Client A had x-rays done. During an interview with RN 1 on 11/10/21 at 1:46 p.m., RN 1 stated she was aware of the injury that had occurred with Client A back in 1/2021. She stated she could not readily recall the specifics at the time of the interview. She stated that she had performed assessments on Client A related to her injuries sustained on 1/8/21. When asked if she was aware that no in person assessment had been performed by an RN on 1/8/21 (the date that Client A's injuries were noticed), RN 1 stated she did not recall first hand. She stated when a client had a change of condition, the nurse had 24 hours to do an 
in-person assessment. RN 1 stated if there was an immediate need, the nurse was expected to 
(within two hours) direct the client to be seen in either the emergency room or Urgent Care. She stated she would not tell staff to wait until she got there to assess the client. When asked if it would be acceptable practice for the DSP to transport a client with a potential fracture without an RN assessment, nor any stabilization of the affected limb? RN 1 stated she would have to know what was reported to the RN. She also stated she could see how having the DSP transport the client without immobilization of the affected limb could be a concern. During a review of the facility's policy and procedure titled, ""Best Possible Health"" last review date 2/24/21, it indicated,"" ...

Findings: 
1. During a review of the facility's Incident Report dated 1 /8/21, it indicated Client A was found to have a bruise forming on her left shoulder on
1/8/21 at ""approximately"" 1 :45 p.m. The qualified intellectual disabilities professional (QIDP) documented Client A's left shoulder had a light purple bruise and her shoulder ""was swollen an appeared slightly displaced."" On 1/13/21 at 10:15 a.m., during an unannounced visit to investigate circumstances surrounding Client A's unwitnessed injuries: 
[Hematoma (pool of clotted blood formed in an area of the body) of her left shoulder; a left 
clavi.cle (collarbone) fracture; left humerus (bone of the upper arm) fracture; and a left upper extremity contusion (bruise)], an observation was also made of Client A's bedroom. A large brown Sherpa (thick, furry, fleece) dog bed was observed on the floor at Client A's bedside. Client A was hospitalized and was not in at the facility at the time. During an interview with DSP 3 on 1/13/21 at 4 p.m., she stated she arrived at 6 a.m. for work on 1/8/21. She stated she saw Client A lying on her back on the floor ""mat"" (large pillow), in her bedroom. She stated Client A had a pillow and a blanket. She stated (when Client A's 1 :1 staff
[DSP 2] arrived) they did a 2-person transfer using Client A's gaitbelt (an assistive device worn around the waist of an individual for staff to use to help with sitting, standing and transfers). DSP 3 stated they (she and DSP 2) transferred Client A from the floor to her bed, then transferred her to the wheelchair. DSP 3 stated Client A was ""dead weight"" and ""did not help with transfers at all."" DSP 3 stated Client A would sometimes assist with transferring to the toilet by holding the grab bar, but she did not do it that day. 
During a telephone interview with the QIDP on 10/13/21 at 1: 10 p.m., was asked if it was expected that Client A would be on the floor pillow in her room, when she refused to get back into bed after toileting during the night. The QIDP stated the Human Rights Committee (HRC) had approved Client A's use of the floor pillow, but stated it was more for the use in the living room to stay in view of the staff. During an interview with DSP 1 on 11/10/21 at 
12:58 p.m., she stated between 3 - 4 a.m. on 
1/8/21, Client A woke up and ""She helped me take her to the bathroom."" DSP 1 stated, ""We were kind of struggling ... she was yelling and resistive and not holding on the side bar"" (in the restroom). After toileting Client A, DSP 1 stated Client A was yelling while she put the (protective undergarment) on the client. DSP 1 stated she wheeled Client A back to her bedroom, but Client A would not get back in bed. She stated Client A was ""Really stiff and wouldn't assist to get back into bed."" DSP 1 stated when Client A resisted getting back into bed, Client A could lay on the large pillow on the floor near her bed. When asked to describe the large pillow, DSP 1 stated it was four feet by three feet (large circular dog bed). When asked if it was usually kept in Client A's room at night, DSP 1 stated ""Yes."" She stated other night shift staff used it (for Client A) too. When asked if she was trained on the use of the large floor pillow, DSP 1 stated ""No,"" but also stated she was to lay her on one side or the other side (client's left or right side}. When asked if Client A was to stay in the line of vision when she was placed on the large floor pillow, DSP 1 replied, ""No."" When asked how often she monitored Client A while she was on the floor pillow, she stated she checked her every 15 - 30 minutes. When asked if she had offered Client A the option to sit in the living room and watch television (TV) or listen to music, DSP 1 stated she had not, because Client A was yelling and she did not want her to wake up the other clients. During a review of Client A's ISP dated 10/22/20, it contained a Service Objective (an objective that is implemented by staff, but requires no routine data collection), for ""Getting out of bed."" This objective indicated Client A would at times wake up, become agitated and not want to be in bed. Client A would exhibit behaviors of attempting to pull herself out of bed and would crawl out. Client A would then sit on the floor and yell for staff, placing her at risk for fall and injury. If Client A was attempting to get out of bed, the objective stipulated, ""It is okay for staff assist [sic] her into the living room to watch TV or listen to music until she calms down and is ready to go back to sleep."" During a review of Nursing Notes dated 2/ 11/20 at 2:20 p.m., entered into the computer by RN 3, she documented a plan for the ""Use of dog 
bed/HCP (Health Care Plan) Falls."" She documented, ""[Client A] now has a soft dog bed to help alleviate injuries from accidental falls ... "" The interventions included,"" ... 1. From now on place soft dog bed in front of couch whenever 
[Client A] is not in her wheelchair.so [sic] that if she tumbles off couch she will land on dog bed. Keep her within eyesight at all times ... "" 
During an interview with RN 1 on 11/10/21 at 2:20 p.m., she stated she was not aware that staff
used the large pillow at Client A's bedside at night. She stated, ""That's not what we wanted them to do."" She stated staff were, ""Not
expected to leave her (Client A) unmonitored."" During a review of Client A's Human Rights Committee (HRC) Meeting minutes dated 11/30/20, it indicated the HRC had approved the use of the ""Floor pillow to prevent fall injury near couch."" There was no documentation of an approval for the use of the floor pillow in Client A's bedroom. During a review of the facility's policy and procedure titled, ""Person Directed Planning"" last review date 10/14/19, it indicated,"" ... A team process is utilized to develop a comprehensive and person-centered plan to ensure needs and goals are achieved through the implementation of supports ... C.

1/8/21, Client A woke up and ""She helped me take her to the bathroom."" DSP 1 stated, ""We were kind of struggling ... she was yelling and
resistive and not holding on the side bar"" (in the restroom). DSP 1 stated she wheeled Client A back to her bedroom, but Client A would not get back in bed. She stated Client A was ""Really stiff and wouldn't assist to get back into bed."" When asked if there was a second staff person who worked with DSP 1 on the night shift, she stated there was not. When asked if Client A required a two-person transfer, DSP 1 stated Client A could be transferred with one staff member using Client A's gaitbelt. When asked if she usually transferred Client A alone during the night shift, DSP 1 replied, ""Yes."" When asked if Client A usually assisted with transfers, DSP 1 stated she did. When asked if she had used Client A's gaitbelt for the transfer during the night shift, DSP 1 stated she did not. When asked if she usually used Client A's gaitbelt to assist her during transfers, DSP 1 stated she did not. During a review of Client A's HRC Meeting minutes, dated 11/30/20, they indicated Client A had a reduction in mobility, and ""due to policy, a transfer procedure must be implemented and is awaiting PCP (primary care physician)and PT (physical therapist) protocol and training."" The HRC Meeting Minutes also indicated Client A was to have a gait belt used for safety. During a review of Client A's Comprehensive Functional Assessment (CFA) dated 7/28/20, it indicated in the section titled, ""Mobility"" Client A required total assistance in weight bearing and transfers. In the comments, the QIDP documented, ""Needs 2 person transfer, see protocol."" During a telephone interview with the QIDP, on 11/4/21 at 2:50 p.m., when asked what was the expectation for Client A's transfers, he stated this was discussed at the HRC meetings. He stated it was the facility's plan to develop a protocol for 2-person transfers based on the input from Client A's physician and the PT. The QIDP stated as of the date of this interview, no protocol had yet been developed for Client A. When asked if there were two staff assigned during the night shift (as identified in the CFA), the QIDP stated the facility only provided one night shift staff member. He stated staff were aware that Client A could assist with transfers, but if she chose to be resistive, staff could opt to allow Client A to use the incontinence briefs in bed. During a review of Client A's Health Care Plan 
(HCP) titled, ""Will be free of spontaneous fracture"" last review date 11/4/21, it indicated direct support professionals were to ""Lift patient with 2 people assist, if necessary ... "" During a review of Client A's HCP for Transfers, dated 10/5/20, it indicated Client A was a ""Two+ persons Physical Assist,"" ""Provide appropriate level of assistance to promote safety of resident"" and instructed staff to, ""Provide assistive devices."" During a review of Client A's Physician's Orders dated 1/19/21, it indicated Client A's diagnoses included osteoporosis (brittle and fragile bones) and she was also on aspirin therapy (which would lead to an increased tendency for bleeding). During a review of the facility's In-Service Training Verification Form titled, ""Timely and Safe Work practices"" dated 9/22/20, it indicated, "" ... A side note to rushing: this includes safe handling of the individuals. Transfers shall be done according to policy and all non-ambulatory individuals will be done with two staff. It is better to spend 30 seconds to one minute assisting than hours on an injury for you or for that individual. This is also company policy."" DSP 1 signed as attending this inservice. During a review of the facility's policy and procedure titled, ""Best Possible Health"" last review date 2/24/21, it indicated,"" ... 4. Each person will have in place appropriate

1/8/21 at ""approximately"" 1 :45 p.m. The QIDP documented Client A's left shoulder had a light purple bruise and her shoulder ""was swollen an appeared slightly displaced.""
During an interview on 1/13/21 at 12 noon, the QIDP stated he was doing an investigation (into what caused Client A's injuries). He stated multiple staff had handled Client A that morning (1/8/21). He stated he came in to investigate the incident on 1/8/21 and discussed Client A's status with RN 1 via computer tablet (face time). The QIDP stated Client A's left shoulder looked 
""displaced"" and she had a dark purple bruise right below her shoulder joint. He stated he showed RN 1 the client's injuries and the decision was made to send Client A to urgent care for further follow-up. During a review of the acute hospital's Emergency Physician Notes dated 1/8/21 at 7:01 p.m., the notes indicated: Client A had a hematoma (pool of clotted blood formed in an area of the body) of her left shoulder; she had a left clavicle (collarbone) fracture; left humerus (bone of the upper arm) fracture; and a left upper extremity contusion (bruise). During an interview with the QIDP on 1/13/21 at 12:05 p.m., the QIDP stated Direct Support 
Professional (DSP) 1 worked the night shift and had assisted Client A to the restroom at 4 a.m. He stated that when DSP 1 went to return Client A to her bed after toileting, Client A was resistive and did not want to go back to bed. The QIDP stated DSP 1 allowed Client A to lay on the floor (on a large pillow next to bed). The QIDP stated the DSPs did not notice any bruises on Client A at that time. DSP 2 and DSP 3 reported checking on Client A's status throughout the day and contacted the program manager (PM) at 1 :30 p.m., when they observed a bruise (forming on her left shoulder area). During an interview with the QIDP on 10/13/21 at 1 p.m., he stated RN 1 did not accompany him to the facility to assess Client A when her initial injury was observed (on 1/8/21 at approximately 1 :30 p.m.). He stated an RN did not come to the facility to assess Client A, but stated RN 1 did assess Client A via use of the computer tablet. The QIDP stated after seeing Client A's injuries via computer tablet, she stated Client A needed to be transported to Urgent Care for further evaluation. The QIDP stated DSP 2 was directed to transport Client A to Urgent Care. When asked if anyone stabilized Client A's arm prior to transport to Urgent Care, the QIDP stated Client A's arm was not stabilized. The QIDP stated DSP 2 took Client A, (in her wheelchair), to Urgent Care in the facility's van. He stated Client A was still moving her arm a little. He stated he was not aware of any fracture until Client A had x-rays done. During an interview with RN 1 on 11/10/21 at 1 :46 p.m., RN 1 stated she was aware of the injury that had occurred with Client A back in 1 /2021. 
She stated she could not readily recall the specifics at the time of the interview. She stated that she had performed assessments on Client A related to her injuries sustained on 1/8/21. When asked if she was aware that no in person assessment had been performed by an RN on 
1/8/21 (the date that Client A's injuries were noticed), RN 1 stated she did not recall first hand. She stated when a client had a change of 
condition, the nurse had 24 hours to do an in-person assessment. RN 1 stated if there was an immediate need, the nurse was expected to 
(within two hours) direct the client to be seen in either the emergency room or Urgent Care. She stated she would not tell staff to wait until she got there to assess the client. When asked if it would be acceptable practice for the DSP to transport a client with a potential fracture without an RN assessment, nor any stabilization of the affected limb? RN 1 stated she would have to know what was reported to the RN. She also stated she could see how having the DSP transport the client without immobilization of the affected limb could be a concern. During a review of the facility's policy and procedure titled, ""Best Possible Health"" last review date 2/24/21, it indicated,"" ...

interview the intermediate care facility for
individuals with intellectual disabilities (ICF-IID)
failed to implement appropriate measures
outlined in facility policies and procedures to
actively prevent the spread of COVID-19 to
individuals living in the home. Specifically, the
ICF-IID failed to ensure the staff screening
process took place prior to entering the home and
failed to assure traveling nursing staff donned
proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and
followed the facility's handwashing procedures.
Findings include:
I. Observations
A. First focused
1. Prior to entering the home for observation on
8/17/20 at 4:50 p.m. the program manager (PM)
asked a series of COVID-19 related questions,
performed a temperature check and determined
oxygen saturation using an oximeter for two visitors. Following the first screening, the PM
used an alcohol swab to wipe down the remote
thermometer before taking the second visitor's
temperature. The oximeter was placed on the
second visitor's finger without disinfecting the
device.
2. Later that evening, at 6:40 p.m., the PM was
asked about the infection control process for the
oximeter. Initially, she was unable to answer the
question and said she needed to research the
information. She excused herself from the area
and returned approximately 5 minutes later. She
stated the infection control procedure for the
oximeter was to wipe down the device with
alcohol between each use.
3. At approximately 6:00 p.m., contrary to the
facility's COVID-19 infection control policy, the
lead staff of the facility was observed completing
the screening process after entering the home.
He documented his temperature and oxygen
saturation on a form affixed to a clipboard which
sat on a table adjacent to the front door. Alcohol
wipes, extra masks, an oximeter and
thermometer were also on the table. Hand
sanitizer was not on the table for use when
entering or exiting the home.
4. Licensed practical nurse (LPN) #1 was
observed entering the facility at 6:42p.m. She
proceeded to complete the COVID-19 screening
process after she entered the home. First, she
was observed wiping both the remote
thermometer and oximeter down with alcohol.
While both devices dried she filled out the
screening questionnaire. Next, she took her
temperature and her oxygen saturation. She sat
the oximeter down on the table without
disinfecting the device. After donning a gown and mask she picked up the wrappers from the
alcohol swabs she used and threw them in a
trash can. LPN #1 was then observed walking
directly from the screening table to the medication
cart in the living room without washing her hands
or using hand sanitizer. She proceeded to
prepare and administer individual #3's medication
without washing her hands, using hand sanitizer
or putting on gloves.
LPN #1 prepared individual #1's medications
next. She was not observed using hand sanitizer,
washing her hands or donning gloves prior to
preparing individual #1's medication. After his oral
medication and creams were placed in two
different plastic medication cups, the LPN walked
to the kitchen pantry. She got a pudding cup from
the pantry. She said, individual #1 preferred his
medications in pudding. A later observation
revealed pudding was available in the cabinet
next to the medication cart in the living room. She
proceeded to mix his oral medications with a
small amount of pudding. At 7:02 p.m., the LPN
entered individual #1's bedroom to administer his
medications. Before she fed him his medication,
she put on gloves. Following his oral medication
administration, she rubbed cream onto his right
arm. The LPN doffed and disposed of her gloves
before leaving the bedroom. She then walked to
the kitchen and washed her hands before
preparing individual #2's medication. The LPN
prepared individual #2's medication without
putting on gloves, and fed them to her in pudding
while the individual was in the bathroom getting
dressed after a shower.
B. Second focused
The facility registered nurse (RN) was observed
entering the home on 8/18/20 at 11:53 a.m. He
proceeded to fill out the COVID-19 screening form information, take his temperature and
oxygen saturation inside the front door. He
donned a new mask before asking the PM why
hand sanitizer was not available at the screening
station. The RN washed his hands at the kitchen
sink and joined the PM for a meeting. At
approximately 12:28 p.m., the RN wearing a
mask and gloves, was observed administering a
medication to individual #3. He was not wearing
goggles or a gown.
II. Record review
A. A document titled COVID-19 Essential Persons
Screening was reviewed on 8/18/20. The
document read all essential persons entering the
home were required to be screened as a COVID
19 infection control prevention strategy. The
document contained the following five questions
staff were expected to ask essential personnel
entering the home:
-""Have you had signs or symptoms of a
respiratory infection, such as a fever (above 100
degrees), new or worsening cough, shortness of
breath, sore throat, chill, repeated shaking with
chills, muscle pain, headache (with other
symptoms), new loss of taste or smell, fatigue,
congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting,
diarrhea, and/or oxygen level below 88%?""
-""Have you had contact in the last 14 days with
someone with a confirmed or suspected
diagnosis of COVID-19?""
-""Have you been tested for COVID and still
awaiting test results?""
-""Have you been quarantined by public health or
been advised to self-isolate by a physician within
the last 14 days?""
-""Have you traveled internationally within the last
14 days to countries with sustained community
transmission?"" The document read ""essential persons shall only
enter the home if they respond 'no' to every
screening criterion question above"". Per the
observations above, nursing staff and facility staff
entered the home and then completed the
screening process.
B. A document titled Handwashing Procedure
was reviewed on 8/18/20. It read handwashing
was the ""single most important measure to
reduce the risks of transmitting microorganisms
from one person to another or from one site to
another on the same person."" In pertinent part, it
instructed staff to wash their hands with soap and
water before and after the following:
-Any direct care task
-Working with any person supported
-Application of gloves
-Food Preparation
-Using the bathroom
Per the above observations, LPN #1 did not
implement appropriate handwashing techniques
prior to, during or following medication
administration between individuals.
C. A document titled Nurse PPE/Minimal Contact
Information was reviewed on 8/18/20. The
document contained the following PPE
requirements for nurses:
- ""You will each have a kit (unlabeled) which
contains gown, mask, 2 pairs shoe covers. Pick a
kit, put your name on it. You will have a kit at each
program. (Plus we will have a few spares at each
program). Goggles need to be worn as well, if you
do not wear glasses.""
- ""You will use this same gown, mask and shoe covers minimally for 1 week. You will put the PPE
on, use it only for that program, and then rebag
it.""
- ""If you do not want to wear the shoe covers, you
must disinfect your shoes prior to entering the
next house (or have back up shoes in the car -
but each program you work needs separate
pair).""
- ""If you need a pair of goggles and do not already
have them, there will be a few extras at each
house. They will need to be disinfected each time
and reused by you - so if you get a pair, put them
in your bag.""
Per the observations above, LPN #1 did not wear
the recommended full PPE (gown, mask, shoe
coverings and goggles) upon entering the facility.
III. Interview
The director of nursing (DON) was interviewed on
8/18/20 at 9:49 a.m. concerning PPE
expectations for nursing staff entering the home.
She said because the facility's LPNs and RN
travel from home to home she expected nursing
to complete the screening process prior to
entering the home. When asked where nursing
staff should complete the screening, she
answered with ""technically outside."" The DON
further stated she was aware screening was not
taking place prior to entering the home, but facility
policy and procedure dictated the process should
be completed outside of the home. She further
stated, nursing staff was expected to don a gown,
mask, goggles or face shield and shoe covers.
The DON said shoe covers were optional, but if
they were declined by nursing staff, the staff were
required to have a different pair of shoes to wear
for each new environment they entered. She also
stated each nurse had an assigned PPE kit. The DON was informed of the above observations
and confirmed all staff and visitor COVID-19
screening should occur outside the home, the
oximeter needed to be disinfected between uses
and traveling nurses were required to don full
PPE, follow the facility's hand washing procedure
and don new gloves between working with
individuals. The DON did state that if the home
was the first home nursing staff visited that day,
full PPE would not be required. Standard PPE
(mask and gloves) was the expectation if the
nurse hadn't visited another facility that day."

 E 716
Based on observations, interviews and record
review, the facility failed to properly prevent and
contain COVID-19. Specifically, staff failed to
follow Standard Precautions and perform
consistent hand hygiene to prevent the spread of
infection. Three of the five individuals (individuals
#2, #3 and #5) residing in the home were
hospitalized due to COVID-19. One individual
(#1) exhibited symptoms of COVID-19 and had
been isolated at home.
Findings include:
1. Observation
An observation of the home was conducted on
8/10/20 from 12:41 p.m. to 1:45 p.m. The
registered nurse (RN) and the licensed practical
nurse (LPN) were present during the observation.
During the observation direct support professional
(DSP) #1 was observed assisting individual #1 by attaching a communication device to his
wheelchair. She was wearing gloves and a
surgical mask. After assisting individual #1 she
was observed going into individual #4's room to
get him a ball. She tossed him the ball but did not
change her gloves or perform hand hygiene after
assisting individual #1. After tossing the ball to
individual #4 she was observed preparing
individual #1 to go outside. With the same gloves
on, she reached into a bin containing lotions and
creams. She removed a container of sunscreen
which she applied to individual #1's skin. She was
observed to put the sunscreen container back
into the bin. She did not perform hand hygiene
before removing the sunscreen from the bin and
she did not change her gloves or wash her hands
before putting the sunscreen back into the bin,
thereby potentially contaminating all items in the
bin.
When asked, she agreed the bin contained items
shared between individuals in the home. She also
agreed she did not wash her hands prior to or
after applying the sunscreen to individual #1.
2. Document review
a. Review of the COVID-19 tracking report
provided by the facility on 8/11/20 revealed
individuals #2, #3 and #5 tested positive for
COVID-19 and individual #1 exhibited symptoms
of COVID-19, which included congestion or runny
nose. The tracking report also revealed
individuals #2, #3 and #5 were hospitalized on
7/23/20. Individual #3 was discharged on 8/4/20
but as reported by the RN, was admitted to a
skilled nursing facility due to weakness
subsequent to his illness. Individuals #2 and #5
were hospitalized as of 8/11/20 and had not yet
been discharged. b. Review of the document titled COVID-19
Coronavirus Support Protocol dated 4/7/20 under
the section titled Prevention - Level 1 Specific
Directions, read, in part, ""Following CDC
recommendations, to prevent an outbreak of
COVID-19, it is important to always use Standard
Precautions.""
3. Interview
a. The RN was interviewed during the home visit.
She agreed that taking items out of and placing
them back in a shared bin without proper hand
hygiene could potentially contaminate all the
items in the bin. She said, ""I see that now.""
b. The LPN also agreed the items could be
contaminated. She removed all the items from

Locked:
This STANDARD is not met as evidenced by: a
loose medication dropped on the floor during
medication administration preparation and was
left unsecure on the floor for approximately 10
minutes. Findings include:
I. Observation
An observation of a medication pass at the facility
on 5/26/21 beginning at 6:33 am was conducted
with the licensed practical nurse (LPN) on duty.
The medication cart, cabinet and record book
was kept in the living room. She began with
individual #1's medication. The LPN opened the
book containing the medication administration
records (MARs) and turned to individual #1. The first step she completed was cross referencing
each medication package with the corresponding
MAR entry. Next, while cross referencing the
MAR she placed each medication in a small
plastic cup either by popping it out of a bubble
pack, removing it from a bottle or taking it out of a
package. After she popped out two Lamictal 150
milligram (mg) pills into the plastic medication
cup, she turned the pill card over. The next
medication card underneath the Lamictal pill card;
magnesium oxide 400 mg, contained two loose
pills on top of the card. Upon closer examination,
the LPN was able to determine the pills were two
150mg Lamictal pills. As she was trying to
determine what the loose pills were she picked up
the magnesium oxide medication card and the
two loose pills fell. One pill fell into the medication
cup filled with individual #1's prepared medication
and the other one fell onto the ground. The LPN
removed the pill that fell into the medication cup
with a spoon. She looked around on the floor for
the second pill and did not find it. Directly
following, at 6:54 am, the LPN locked the
medication cart and walked across the room to
where individual #1 was seated to administer her
medication.
At 6:57 am the LPN finished administering
individual #1's medications and walked back
toward the medication cart. As she approached
the cart she looked down and said, ""look there is
the other pill."" She proceeded to doff her gloves,
sanitize her hands and don new gloves. As she
picked up the stethoscope, she explained that
she needed to check individual #1's heart rate,
lungs, status of lower extremity edema and ask
her questions pertaining to potential side effects
from the psychotropic medication she took. The
LPN walked past the pill on the ground and
across the room to individual #1 to complete the aforementioned tasks. At 7:01 am, the LPN
walked past the pill a second time, without picking
the pill up and continued walking to the
medication cart. She signed individual #1's
MARs. At 7:04 am the LPN walked past the pill
on the ground for a third time without picking it
up. One minute later this surveyor approached
the LPN and asked her to pick the pill up off the
ground and secure it, as it could be a potential
health hazard if an individual decided to ingest
the pill. She explained that she was conflicted on
how to proceed once the pill was noticed on the
ground. She said she wasn't sure if she should
contaminate her hands and pick the pill up, or
continue with her medication pass and pick the
pill up when she was done passing all the
individual's medications. Additionally, she
reported she was uncertain how to handle the
dropped medication other than informing the
house nurse that it occurred.
II. Record review
A. Review of individual #1's record revealed
physician's orders dated 4/26/21. Among the
medications listed was an order for Lamictal 150
mg tab, take two tabs (300 mg) by mouth twice
daily for seizures.
B. The facility's policy on medication procedures,
dated 1/17/19 was also reviewed. Section E, part
VI of the policy read, ""While administering the
medication, staff should never leave the
medication unattended.""
C. The facility's policy on medication disposal,
dated 12/13/19 documented the facility's
procedure on how to handle a medication that
was dropped on the ground. The purpose of the
policy included the following statement; ""To support safe and effective medication
management. Prevent accidental exposure or
misappropriation of medicine."" Additionally, in
pertinent part the policy read, ""medications that
are ... dropped to the floor...must be destroyed or
disposed of.""
III. Interview
The house nurse was interviewed on 5/26/21
beginning at 7:40 a.m. When asked if the LPN on
duty this morning reported individual #1's
unexplained loose lamictal tabs and subsequent
issues that arose during the morning medication
pass, the house nurse said she was aware that a
medication locked in the top drawer of the
medication cart needed to be destroyed, but that
was the extent of her knowledge concerning the
morning events. After the house nurse was
informed of the events surrounding the morning
medication pass, she confirmed the LPN
exhibited a critical error in judgment when she
chose to continue with her medication pass
without securing the loose medication on the
ground. Further, the house nurse stated she
needed to retrain the LPN on the facility's policy
concerning dropped medication and ensuring all
medications were kept secure to prevent
accidental ingestion by an individual living in the
home. She also stated she would need to
investigate the origin of the loose pills."

The QIDP stated at 8 a.m., when DSP 2 and DSP 3 went to get Client A up for toileting, DSP 3 reported Client A would not assist (by grabbing the grab bar in the restroom), but stated that was not unusual due to Client A's behavior of refusals (resistiveness). He stated the same staff brought Client A to the table for breakfast, but again she refused to eat, (not unusual) so staff fed her.  The QIDP stated Client A had behaviors of screaming and yelling due to her declining mental status, which she usually did. DSP 2 and DSP 3 reported checking on Client A's status throughout the day and contacted the program manager 
(PM) at 1 :30 p.m., when they observed a bruise (forming on her left shoulder area).

This failure allowed Client A to be unsupervised while out of bed and could have led to her sustaining fractures to her left clavicle 
(collarbone), left humerus (upper arm bone), and areas of bruising. 
2. DSP 1 did not have a second person working with her on the night shift, when Client A's Comprehensive Functional Assessment (CFA) identified that she required a 2-person transfer.
This failure had the potential to cause injury to Client A due to a fall or inappropriate manipulation of Client A's body during transfers. Findings: 
1. During a review of the facility's Incident Report dated 1 /8/21, it indicated Client A was found to have a bruise forming on her left shoulder on
1/8/21 at ""approximately"" 1 :45 p.m. The qualified intellectual disabilities professional (QIDP) documented he drove to the facility and spoke with Registered Nurse (RN) 1 (via computer tablet - face-time). The QIDP documented Client A's left shoulder had a light purple bruise and her shoulder ""was swollen an appeared slightly displaced.""
On 1/13/21 at 10:15 a.m., during an unannounced visit to investigate circumstances surrounding Client A's unwitnessed injuries: 
[Hematoma (pool of clotted blood formed in an area of the body) of her left shoulder; a left clavicle (collarbone) fracture; left humerus (bone) of the upper arm) fracture; and a left upper extremity contusion (bruise)], an observation was also made of Client A's bedroom. A large brown Sherpa (thick, furry, fleece) dog bed was observed on the floor at Client A's bedside. Client A was hospitalized and was not in at the facility at the time. During an interview with DSP 3 on 1/13/21 at 4 p.m., she stated she arrived at 6 a.m. for work on 1/8/21. She stated she saw Client A lying on her back on the floor ""mat"" (large pillow), in her bedroom. She stated Client A had a pillow and a blanket. She stated (when Client A's 1: 1 staff
[DSP 2] arrived) they did a 2-person transfer using Client A's gaitbelt (an assistive device worn around the waist of an individual for staff to use to help with sitting, standing and transfers). DSP 3 stated they (she and DSP 2) transferred Client A from the floor to her bed, then transferred her to the wheelchair. DSP 3 stated Client A was ""dead weight"" and ""did not help with transfers at all."" DSP 3 stated Client A would sometimes assist with transferring to the toilet by holding the grab bar, but she did not do it that day. During a telephone interview with the QIDP on 10/13/21 at 1 :10 p.m., was asked if it was expected that Client A would be on the floor pillow in her room, when she refused to get back into bed after toileting during the night. The QIDP stated the Human Rights Committee (HRC) had approved Client A's use of the floor pillow, but stated it was more for the use in the living room to stay in view of the staff. During an interview with DSP 1 on 11/10/21 at 12:58 p.m., she stated between 3 - 4 a.m. on 
1/8/21, Client A woke up and ""She helped me take her to the bathroom."" DSP 1 stated, ""We were kind of struggling ... she was yelling and resistive and not holding on the side bar"" (in the restroom). After toileting Client A, DSP 1 stated Client A was yelling while she put the (protective undergarment) on the client. DSP 1 stated she wheeled Client A back to her bedroom, but Client A would not get back in bed. She stated Client A was ""Really stiff and wouldn't assist to get back into bed."" DSP 1 stated when Client A resisted getting back into bed, Client A could lay on the large pillow on the floor near her bed. When asked to describe the large pillow, DSP 1 stated it was four feet by three feet (large circular dog bed). When asked if it was usually kept in Client A's room at night, DSP 1 stated ""Yes."" She stated other night shift staff used it (for Client A) too. When asked if she was trained on the use of the large floor pillow, DSP 1 stated ""No,"" but also stated she was to lay her on one side or the other side (client's left or right side). When asked if Client A was to stay in the line of vision when she was placed on the large floor pillow, DSP 1 replied, ""No."" When asked how often she monitored Client A while she was on the floor pillow, she stated she checked her every 15 - 30 minutes. When asked if she had offered Client A the option to sit in the living room and watch television (TV) or listen to music, DSP 1 stated she had not, because Client A was yelling and she did not want her to wake up the other clients. During a review of Client A's ISP dated 10/22/20, it contained a Service Objective (an objective that is implemented by staff, but requires no routine data collection), for ""Getting out of bed."" This objective indicated Client A would at times wake up, become agitated and not want to be in bed. Client A would exhibit behaviors of attempting to pull herself out of bed and would crawl out. Client A would then sit on the floor and yell for staff, placing her at risk for fall and injury. If Client A was attempting to get out of bed, the objective stipulated, ""It is okay for staff assist [sic] her into the living room to watch TV or listen to music until she calms down and is ready to go back to sleep."" During a review of Nursing Notes dated 2/11/20 at 2:20 p.m., entered into the computer by RN 3, she documented a plan for the ""Use of dog 
bed/HCP (Health Care Plan) Falls."" She documented, ""[Client A] now has a soft dog bed to help alleviate injuries from accidental falls ... "" The interventions included,"" ... 1. From now on place soft dog bed in front of couch whenever 
[Client A] is not in her wheelchair.so [sic] that if she tumbles off couch she will land on dog bed. Keep her within eyesight at all times ... "" 
During an interview with RN 1 on 11/10/21 at 2:20 p.m., she stated she was not aware that staff used the large pillow at Client A's bedside at night. She stated, ""That's not what we wanted them to do."" She stated staff were, ""Not expected to leave her (Client A) unmonitored."" During a review of Client A's Human Rights Committee (HRC) Meeting minutes dated 
11/30/20, it indicated the HRC had approved the use of the ""Floor pillow to prevent fall injury near couch."" It also indicated Client A's bed was to be near the wall due to the room size. There was no documentation of an approval for the use of the floor pillow in Client A's bedroom. During a review of the facility's policy and procedure titled, ""Person Directed Planning"" last review date 10/14/19, it indicated,"" ... A team process is utilized to develop a comprehensive and person-centered plan to ensure needs and goals are achieved through the implementation of supports ... C.

She stated Client A was ""Really stiff and wouldn't assist to get back into bed."" When asked if there was a second staff person who worked with DSP 1 on the night shift, she stated there was not. When asked if Client A required a two-person transfer, DSP 1 stated Client A could be transferred with one staff member using Client A's gaitbelt. When asked if she usually transferred Client A alone during the night shift, DSP 1 replied, ""Yes."" When asked if Client A usually assisted with transfers, DSP 1 stated she did. When asked if she had used Client A's gaitbelt for the transfer during the night shift, DSP 1 stated she did not. When asked if she usually used Client A's gaitbelt to assist her during transfers, DSP 1 stated she did not. During a review of Client A's HRC Meeting minutes, dated 11/ 30/20, they indicated Client A had a reduction in mobility, and ""due to policy, a transfer procedure must be implemented and is awaiting PCP (primary care physician)and PT 
(physical therapist) protocol and training."" The HRC Meeting Minutes also indicated Client A was to have a gait belt used for safety. 
During a review of Client A's Comprehensive Functional Assessment (CFA) dated 7/28/20 , it indicated in the section titled, ""Mobility"" Client A required total assistance in weight bearing and transfers. In the comments, the QIDP documented, ""Needs 2 person transfer, see protocol."" During a telephone interview with the QIDP, on 11/4/21 at 2:50 p.m., when asked what was the expectation for Client A's transfers, he stated this was discussed at the HRC meetings. He stated it was the facility's plan to develop a protocol for - person transfers based on the input from Client A's physician and the PT. The QIDP stated as of the date of this interview, no protocol had yet been developed for Client A. When asked if there were two staff assigned during the night shift (as identified in the CFA), the QIDP stated the facility only provided one night shift staff member. He stated staff were aware that Client A could assist with transfers, but if she chose to be resistive, staff could opt to allow Client A to use the incontinence briefs in bed.

Findings include: 

 

Record review 

 

Individual #1 

 

A document titled, Physician's Order, for the month of January 2022, was reviewed on 2/3/22. The order read, ""Prevident 5000 Mint 1.1 percent PSTE [paste]. Apply small amount to teeth with tooth brush twice daily for oral health. Done by DSP [direct support professional]."" Although this physician's order included the words ""done by DSP"", the order did not legally authorize direct support professionals to administer medications. Per 6 CCR 1011-1, Chapter 24 – Medication Administration Regulations, only direct support professionals who are also qualified medication administration persons (QMAPs) are authorized to administer medications. 

A medication administration record (MAR) was reviewed for the month of January 2022. The MAR revealed the entry, ""Prevident 5000 Mint 1.1 percent PSTE [paste]. Apply small amount to teeth with tooth brush twice daily for oral health. Done by DSP [direct support professional]."" The hour [of medication administration] box read, ""Done By DSP."" There was no corresponding name of staff administering, date or time documentation of the medication being administered for the entire month. 

 

Individual #2 

 

A document titled, Physician's Order, for the month of January 2022, was reviewed on 2/3/22. Pertinent physician orders (PO) included: 

Benzoyl Per Liq ten percent wash. Apply topically [to the skin] daily for recurrent MRSA furunculosis [a skin infection resistant to antibiotic treatment]. 

Ketoconazole Shampoo two percent. Lather into scalp and ears, leave on for five minutes, then rinse thoroughly three times a week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday for seborrheic dermatitis [an itchy, flaky skin condition]. 

A medication administration record (MAR) was reviewed for the month of January 2022. The MAR revealed the following pertinent entries: 

Benzoyl Per Liq ten percent wash. Apply topically daily for recurrent MRSA furunculosis. ""Done by DSP"" was hand written under the section ""hour"". There was no corresponding name of staff administering, date or time documentation of the medication being administered for the entire month. 

Ketoconazole Shampoo two percent. Lather into scalp and ears, leave on for five minutes, then rinse thoroughly three times a week, Monday, Wednesday and Friday for seborrheic dermatitis. The hour [of medication administration] box read, ""Done By DSP."" There was no corresponding name of staff administering, date or time documentation of the medication being administered for the entire month. 

 

Administrative document review  

 

A document titled, Corporate Policy: Medication Procedures, dated 6/23/21 was reviewed. Section IV. Policy, e. iii [first entry iii] read, ""A MAR is maintained for each individual receiving services. It jmst include: ...the dose; frequency or times of administration ..."" and Section IV. Policy, e. iii [second entry iii] read, ""The MAR must be referenced during medication administration. The medication label is to be checked against the MAR for accuracy. This will be done, at a minimum of three times during the medication pass."" Additionally, the document read, ""vii. All medications/treatments shall be logged immediately after the administration of the medication on the medication administration record (MAR) by the staff person assisting with medication."" 

A document titled, Corporate Policy: Medication Procedures, Colorado Addendum, dated 8/3/21 read, in part, ""II. ICF, a., Only a licensed medical professional such as a Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) or Registered Nurse (RN) may pass medications."" 

 

Interview 

 

The director of nursing was interviewed on 2/3/22 at 3:00 p.m. She said, ""We educate staff to do these things during daily care."" She agreed the medications noted on the MAR that read ""done by DSP"" were not administered by a person licensed to administer medication. She said ""We were doing it wrong."" She also agreed the medications were not adequately documented on the MAR to show they were administered as ordered"

facility failed to ensure an occupational therapist
was available to carry out and monitor the various
professional interventions and recommendations
for one (#1) of four sample individuals.
Findings include:
I. Individual #1
A. Record review
1. Record review for individual #1 beginning on
1/17/2023 revealed the individual had a diagnosis
of cerebral palsy with left hemiparesis due to the
cerebral palsy. He had a history of osteoporosis
resulting in fractures in his hips, legs, and hands.
He used a manual wheelchair for all mobility.
The record revealed an annual Individual
Program Plan (IPP) for individual #1 dated
5/26/22. The IPP documented that an
occupational therapist attended this annual
staffing meeting to discuss the occupational
therapy (OT) needs of individual #1. The IPP
documented an OT assessment dated May 2022 that was prepared for the meeting. The OT
assessment read that individual #1 favored using
his right upper extremities in most situations and
was able to functionally use his right hand. The
OT documented the individual could use his left
upper extremities but only minimally when
prompted or for spontaneous movement. The OT
documented that the individual's left upper
extremities had less range of motion than the
right and the assessment in May 2022 showed
the individual was less able to move his left upper
extremities than he was in May 2020, two years
previously. The OT documented the following
regarding individual #1's left upper extremities
during the May 2022 assessment: ""appeared to
have increased shoulder flexion, scapular mobility
and decreased external rotation on left side""
The OT noted the individual demonstrated
inattention to his left side, especially when eating
or participating in tabletop tasks. The OT
documented that she switched the location of the
individual's bed in his bedroom in order to help
with his neck mobility and attending to his left side
more. The OT documented she attempted
working on increasing individual #1's use of his
left hand more throughout the year and wrote that
his main goals for this year would be to continue
to improve skills and strength for functional tasks
in his left upper extremities. The IPP documented
that the OT made the following recommendations
to be implemented for individual #1 for the next
year to maintain his range of motion:
""This individual should continue NEW MODIFIED
[left upper extremity] LUE [passive range of
motion] PROM [Individual Service and Supports
Plan] ISSP 3 times weekly to maintain LUE
[range of motion] ROM. This individual should continue his LUE PROM &
Active Movement ISSP 3-5 times weekly to
maintain LUE ROM and active functional [left] L
hand movement, decrease pain in neck, improve
posture and improve respiratory status and
functioning.""
2. Further record review revealed an
individualized service and support plan (ISSP)
dated 5/2/22. The ISSP goal read ""[Individual #1]
will maintain Left Upper Extremity Passive Range
of Motion by completing 12 repetitions (3
repetitions of 4 exercises) an average of three
times per week (total trials/4) through June 2023"".
Although this plan read that it was to be
implemented through June 2023, the program
status was ""discontinued"". Documentation on the
program revealed it was discontinued by the
qualified developmental disabilities professional
(QIDP) on 1/14/23.
3. Continued record review revealed a program
service monitoring form which documented the
program monitoring completed by the QIDP
monthly. The form read individual #1 had met the
LUE PROM goal from 2/2022-12/2022 each
month and the goal was no longer relevant. The
note dated December 2022 read ""This goal has
been met for the last few months. The
[interdisciplinary team] IDT agreed that this goal
is no longer relevant and a new goal will be
implemented in January 2023"". There was no
evidence of the IDT notes documenting the
discussion of the discontinuation of the LUE
PROM ISSP with the OT.
4. Record review failed to evidence
documentation the OT was monitoring the outcome of the ISSP, consulting with the IDT
about the individual's progress, or was provided
communication regarding the need to change or
discontinue the LUE PROM ISSP.
B. Interview and email correspondence
1. The senior area director (SAD) was requested
to schedule an interview with the OT for the
survey team on 1/24/23 at 12:34 p.m. The SAD
wrote in an email on 1/24/23 at 12:54 p.m. that
the OT was not available for an interview because
she did not have a current signed contract with
the facility. The SAD wrote in the email that there
was an issue with the contract for the OT that she
was unaware of until recently and therefore the
OT was unable to do anything until her contract
was signed. The SAD stated she was working on
getting a new contract signed.
2. The SAD was interviewed on 1/25/23 at
approximately 8:55a.m. She confirmed all of the
individuals in the home were assigned to this
same OT. She stated that because the OT was
contracted, the individuals were not ""missing out""
because none of them had pressing OT needs.
She confirmed the OT shared with the qualified
intellectual disabilities professional (QIDP) that
she wouldn ' t be able to provide assistance after
1/18/23 due to issues with her contract.
3. The SAD and QIDP were interviewed on
1/25/23 at 1:00 p.m. The SAD stated they
reviewed the goals of all of the individuals in the
facility. The individuals whose goals had been
met were updated at an IDT meeting on 1/14/22.
The SAD confirmed the OT was not at this IDT
meeting due to vacation and the IDT determined
that since individual #1 had met the PROM goal, it was appropriate to discontinue the goal and
work on a communication goal. The QIDP and
SAD confirmed they did not follow up with the OT
to determine if she agreed with the
discontinuation of the ISSP or had further
recommendations to ensure individual #1 did not
lose skills or have regression in his left extremity
range of motion. They stated because
professionals are contracted, they discuss
changes of programming with the professions
only during the annual IPP.
C. Administrative record review
The previous contract for the OT was requested
on 1/24/2023. The facility was unable to provide a
record of the contract for the OT prior to survey
exit."

interview, the facility failed to provide three (#1,
#2 and #3) of three sample individuals a
continuous and consistent active treatment
program that consisted of formal and informal training opportunities to ensure the individual's
needs were addressed formally and informally
across all relevant settings by encouraging,
reinforcing and facilitating the acquisition of daily
living skills, greater independence, and choice.
Specifically, staff did not utilize formal or informal
learning opportunities to implement active
treatment training programs or to support the
individual's needs or preferences as identified in
the individual program plan (IPP).
Findings include:
I. Observation
An observation of the home was conducted on
1/23/2023 from approximately 7:00 a.m. until 9:00
a.m. and again on 1/23/2023 from approximately
11:00 a.m. until 11:50 a.m. Direct care
professional (DSP) #1, DSP #2, lead DSP and
the qualified intellectual disabilities professional
(QIDP) were present upon arrival. Observations
revealed staff members did not implement
opportunities for learning or interact with
individuals based on their documented
preferences to provide the individuals with formal
and informal opportunities for active treatment.
On 1/23/2023 at 7:15 a.m., individual #3 was
observed sitting at the dining room table. The
table in front of her did not have any items to
engage her. The other individuals were still
sleeping. DSP #1 was in the kitchen beginning to
prepare breakfast. DSP #2 was sitting on the
couch in the living room because the DSP had
fallen outside the home when arriving that
morning. The lead DSP was working with the
QIDP to complete required paperwork due to
DSP #2's fall. During this time, DSP #2 was talking to individual #3 from across the room
while the individual sat at the dining room table
and the DSP sat on the couch. At approximately
7:40 a.m. the QIDP was observed assisting DSP
#2 while individual #3 was observed to still be
sitting at the dining room table without activities or
engagement. The lead DSP was observed
moving in and out of the staff office and checking
on other individuals in their bedrooms. At
approximately 7:45 a.m., half an hour later,
individual #3 was observed still sitting at the
dining room table while the lead DSP and DSP #1
started cleaning the table and putting down
placemats. At 7:50 a.m., the lead DSP and the
QIDP assisted DSP #2 out of the home to the car
and the QIDP accompanied DSP #2 to urgent
care. During this time, DSP #1 was assisting
another individual in the bathroom with their
morning routine. This left no staff available to
assist individual #3. At 7:52 a.m. individual #3 got
up from the dining room table and walked into the
staff office. She wandered around the staff office
for approximately two minutes until staff came
back into the home. At that time, individual #3
went and sat back down at the dining room table.
At approximately 7:58 a.m. the lead DSP went
over to the dining room table and asked individual
#3 if she knew her name. Individual #3 responded
to the question with another staff member's
name. The lead DSP told her what her name was
and individual #3 repeated her name. This was
the only staff engagement individual #3 received
since 7:15 a.m. At approximately 8:05 a.m. the
licensed practical nurse (LPN) called individual #3
into the medication room for her morning
medication. At 8:17 a.m. the LPN asked individual
#3 to take her medication cup and drink to the
sink and individual #3 said no. The LPN prompted
individual #3 again, but she again refused. The LPN stated she was finished and individual #3
went back out to the dining room table. At
approximately 8:35 a.m. individual #2 sat at the
table, staff did not encourage her to participate in
any of the breakfast tasks, such as taking her
meal to the table or assisting with preparing her
drink. At 8:37 a.m. the staff brought breakfast to
all of the individuals sitting at the table.
At breakfast, individual #1 was in the living room
watching TV. Individual #1 appeared very sleepy
and staff reported to the LPN that he seemed
tired or could have had a seizure before waking
up. Individual #1 was sitting in his wheelchair in
the living room facing the television. He had a tray
table attached to his wheelchair with two lidded
drinks with straws sitting on the tray. At 8:37 a.m.
DSP #1 brought individual #1 his breakfast which
included oatmeal, toast cut into finger strips and
an apple cut into slices approximately 2.5 inches
x 1.5 inches in size. Individual #1 was not
interested in eating his meal, so DSP #1 took it
back into the kitchen at approximately 8:45 a.m.
On 1/23/2023 at approximately 11:00 a.m. an
observation of the home was conducted. The
program manager (PM), DSP #1 and lead DSP
were present. Upon arrival, individual #2 was by
the door. Individual #2 attempted to grab the
surveyor to lead them into the kitchen. Individual
#2 went into the kitchen and grabbed a coffee
cup. The lead DSP took the cup and told the
individual they could get coffee. The lead DSP
took the individual to the coffee machine and
asked individual #2 to push the button on the
machine to make her beverage. Individual #3 was
again sitting at the table. She was observed
sitting with another individual with activities on the
table in front of them. Individual #3 was observed to follow the PM into the kitchen, but then went
and sat back down at the dining table. Individual
#1 was in his wheelchair in the living room and
was positioned facing toward the TV, this was the
same activity individual #1 was doing during the
morning observation. At approximately 11:07 a.m.
the lead DSP went with individual #2 to the table
and she sat down with individual #3 and the other
individual. The lead DSP took out stickers and
paper and gave each individual sitting at the table
a piece of paper and some stickers. At 11:09 a.m.
DSP #1 turned individual #1's wheelchair to face
the dining room table and gave him some stickers
and a piece of paper. This activity did not appear
to be a functional learning activity or a preferred
activity for any of the individuals. At 11:10 a.m.
individual #2 got up from the table, left the dining
room and went back to her room.
The registered nurse (RN) arrived at
approximately 11:05 a.m. to administer
medications. The RN completed a medication
pass for individual #1 at 11:12 a.m. Staff reported
that he appeared tired since that morning. She
stated they would complete a ""stop and watch""
form and she would administer tylenol since he
was holding his head and possibly had a
headache. At 11:19 a.m. individual #2 came out
of her bedroom and walked around the living
room, then went to the kitchen and took a mug
out of the cabinet. Individual #2 was assisted to
make a beverage only 20 minutes prior. DSP #1
took the mug and put it back into the cabinet and
took another drink out of the fridge. She asked
individual #2 to please drink that drink because
the individual needed to stay hydrated; individual
#2 pushed the drink away. DSP #1 started
making tea for individual #2. Individual #2 then
went back to her bedroom. Staff did not provide any encouragement for individual #2 to come out
of her room and participate in the task or any
other activity. Per individual #2's IPP, staff were
supposed to provide opportunities for
conversation, social activities, and use of a
communication device as a means to encourage
her to come out of her room. During the
observation, staff never engaged individual #2 in
any of the recommended activities, formally or
informally. At 11:30 a.m. the RN took individual
#2's medication to her in her bedroom. Individual
#2 took her medication and the RN assisted her
in putting hand sanitizer on her hands. Individual
#2 went back and sat on her bed following this
interaction. During this same time, the lead DSP
was sitting with individual #3 at the table putting
glue on her paper and DSP #1 was sitting with
another individual assisting with a craft.
II. Record review
A. Individual #1
Record review for individual #1 beginning
1/17/2023 revealed an individualized program
plan (IPP) dated 5/26/2022. The IPP read
individual #1 needed assistance from staff for all
activities of daily living including personal
hygiene, dressing, toileting, meal preparation,
medication administration, leisure activities,
transferring, and mobility. The IPP read individual
#1 needed staff assistance for all hygiene tasks,
but should be encouraged to wash his hands as
independently as possible. The IPP read the
individual could self feed, but needed an adapted
spoon and assistance for cutting food. The IPP
read his preferred foods were finger foods and he
did not prefer fruits or vegetables. The IPP read
he enjoyed being a passive participant in the kitchen when meals were being cooked. The IPP
read Individual #1 had diagnoses including
cerebral palsy and left hemiparesis. He used a
manual wheelchair for mobility and relied on staff
to propel the wheelchair and change his
position.The IPP read individual #1's preferences
included spending time with peers and staff,
talking about or looking at animals and tractors,
watching movies (westerns) and TV shows
(Green Acres, Flintstones) and doing puzzles. His
IPP read he enjoyed doing puzzles, looking at
books, and using tabletop sensory objects, but
his attention to tasks could fluctuate and staff
should communicate with him the expectation
and wait for him to respond when attempting
activities. The IPP further read staff should
continue to provide opportunities for individual #1
to participate in naming activities and group social
activities and were encouraged to provide the
individual an extended time period to respond
and participate in activities.
Per the observation, individual #1 was lethargic
and possibly had a seizure that morning. While
staff communicated these concerns to the nurse,
his preferences and choices were not informally
offered or encouraged. He was observed initially
to be lethargic and sitting in his wheelchair
positioned in front of the TV for an extended
period of time and then observed to be offered
stickers and paper which he did not show interest
in. Further he was offered a meal that did not
include any of his preferred foods and was not
given extended time to participate in the meal.
B. Individual #2
Record review for individual #2 beginning
1/23/2023 revealed an IPP dated 10/25/2022 The speech language pathologist (SLP)
assessment recommended the staff to encourage
individual #2's participation with peers and to
frequently initiate conversation with her. The IPP
continued to read, encourage social activities
such as playing a game, watching tv, or listening
to music with others, and explore a wide variety of
activities for recreation and cognitive
stimulation.The SLP further recommended staff
to encourage use of forms augmentative and
alternative device (AAC) such as a picture choice
board to increase expressive communication.
The IPP read, staff were to encourage the use of
the AAC device by providing continual access,
maximal modeling and verbal prompting for
individual #2 to use for requests.
Further review of the IPP revealed an occupation
therapy (OT) assessment dated October 2022.
The OT assessment documented the individual
could participate in basic activities of daily living
(ADL) tasks such as self dressing, self-feeding,
and grooming tasks with verbal prompting. The
OT assessment further read, with prompts,
individual #2 could bring her dishes to the sink,
sweep the floor, complete simple kitchen tasks,
use the Keurig machine for making beverages,
and do other simple household tasks such as
wiping the table. The assessment read individual
#2 appeared to find ""meaning, purpose, and
enjoyment"" in completing ADL tasks and she
would continue to benefit from opportunities to
complete these tasks at home and at day
programming. It further read ""Every attempt
should be made of staff to involve her in ADLs
such as washing tables, clearing tables, putting
away groceries, changing her own TV channels,
making her own meals and drinks"" The OT made
recommendations including encouraging individual #2 to be out of her room as much as
possible. The OT wrote ""Staff should encourage
[individual #2] regular participation in safe,
functional activities including matching games
and melting beads, painting nails and group
activities while at the house instead of sitting in
bed watching TV for hours"" Per the observations
of individual #2 on 1/23/23, individual #2 was not
offered formal or informal opportunities to
participate in any of the identified household
tasks including helping in the kitchen except for
being asked to push the button on the Keurig
machine. She was also not observed to be
encouraged to come out of her room to
participate in any preferred or functional activities.
Rather she was observed to wander about the
house in a meaningless manner and sit in her
bedroom.
C. Individual #3
Record review for individual #3 beginning on
1/23/2023 revealed an IPP dated 10/6/2022. The
IPP read for individual #3 read: ""I really enjoy
interacting with others and am eager to take part
in what is going on around me"". The IPP
continued to read ""[Individual #3] needs
supervision to serve her food, prepare meals, and
plan meals. [Individual #3] enjoys participating in
meal preparation, setting/clearing the dining
table, and pouring her own drinks and will
complete these tasks with verbal prompts."" The
occupational therapist (OT) assessment within
the IPP recommended individual #3 continue to
improve on household activities including
cleaning the table, loading the dishwasher,
making her own simple meals, helping in the
kitchen with tasks such as pouring, mixing, using
the microwave with cues, taking out and putting away items and setting placemats on the table.
The OT assessment further read to encourage
the individual's regular participation in safe,
functional group activities on Zoom or videos
including exercise classes, seated yoga, kicking a
ball, sorting objects, puzzles, art projects, and
UNO. Per the observations of individual #3 on
1/23/23, individual #3 was not offered formal or
informal opportunities to participate in any of the
identified household tasks including helping in the
kitchen or setting the table although she was
observed sitting at the table for extended periods
of time.
III. Interviews
A. Individual #1
1. DSP #1 and the lead DSP were interviewed on
1/23/2023 during the observation from 7:00 a.m.
to 9:00 a.m. During the observation both DSP #1
and the lead DSP expressed that individual #1
was presenting more tired than usual and stated
it was possible he had a seizure during the early
morning and that could have contributed to his
lethargy and lack of activity.
2. The senior area director (SAD) was
interviewed on 1/24/2023 at 3:00 p.m. She stated
individual #1 was getting older. She stated he
was most likely away from the table for crafts
because he was easily overstimulated. She
stated he often preferred to do activities by
himself and that during his down days it was often
difficult to determine if he wanted staff to engage
with him or not. She stated the staff at the home
had done a great job of engaging the individuals
previously and stated she was surprised to hear
that he was not engaged during the observations. B. Individual #2
1. The SLP was interviewed on 1/24/2023 at
approximately 12:04 p.m. She stated she would
expect to see active treatment from staff such as
staff engaging with individual #2 to make a choice
between preferred items. She stated while, not
her area of expertise, she felt individual #2 would
benefit from informal active treatment such as
taking items to and from the table and to the sink
after meals. She acknowledged that would be the
OT's area of expertise to determine those tasks.
2. The SAD was interviewed on 1/24/2023 at
approximately 3:00 p.m. The SAD stated she
would expect to see staff engage with individuals
in activities that were meaningful and attainable
for them, and this would differ depending on each
individual. She said she would expect to see staff
providing opportunities. She stated individual #2
didn't like being around a lot of people and felt
this was a factor during observations. She
acknowledged that the observations did not
capture staff initiating engagement with individual
#2.
C. Individual #3
1. The SAD, PM and QIDP were interviewed on
1/24/2023 at 3:00 p.m. The SAD confirmed that
at times staff may not engage individual #3 to
assist with her meal prep individually and would
""just do it for all of the individuals at the same
time"". The PM stated that individual #3 was often
shy around new people and felt that contributed
to the lack of active treatment during the
observation. The SAD acknowledged she did not
feel the observations captured staff initiating engagement with individual #3"

interview, the facility failed to ensure physician
prescribed diet modifications were provided
correctly for one (#1) of two sample individuals.
Findings include:
I. Record review
1. Record review for individual #1 beginning
1/17/2023 revealed a diet order dated 1/4/23. The
diet order read ""Chopped diet (cut into pieces no
larger than ½ inch x ½ inch x ½ inch). Soft foods
that can easily be eaten without utensils (hand to
mouth) can be served whole or cut into strips that
will easily fit in his hand. Frequently eaten foods
that can remain whole are: granola bars, french
fries, hash browns, tater tots, fish sticks, chicken
strips, fish filets, bananas, popsicles, potato
chips, cookies, and crackers. Sandwiches,
waffles, and toast can be cut in half or quarters.
Mashed potatoes should be served with gravy
and not dry"".
2. Further record review revealed a protocol titled
""Aspiration/Choking"" dated 1/19/23. The protocol
read ""[Individual #1] is at risk for
choking/aspiration due to: seizure disorder,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a history of
choking"". The protocol continued to read ""Foods
commonly associated with choking include: Hotdogs served whole, chicken on the bone,
grapes, peanut butter, peanut butter sandwiches
on soft bread, thick chewy bread such as bagels
and pizza crusts, marshmallows, dry, crumbly
foods such as cornbread or rice served without
butter, jelly sauce, etc, dry meats such as ground
beef served without sauce or gravy, whole, raw
vegetables in large pieces, whole hard fruits such
as apples or pears, candy with large nuts, hard
nuts"".
II. Observation
An observation of the home was conducted on
1/23/2023 from approximately 7:00 a.m. until 9:00
a.m. Direct care professional (DSP) #1, DSP #2,
lead DSP and the qualified intellectual disabilities
professional (QIDP) were present upon arrival.
Observations revealed staff members did not
implement the correct diet consistency for
individual #1.
At approximately 8:37 a.m. staff brought
breakfast to the individuals. Individual #1 was
sitting in his wheelchair in the living room facing
the television. He had a tray table attached to his
wheelchair with two lidded drinks with straws
sitting on the tray. At 8:37 a.m. DSP #1 brought
individual #1 his breakfast which included
oatmeal, toast cut into finger strips and an apple
cut into slices approximately 2.5 inches x 1.5
inches in size. Individual #1 appeared lethargic
and possibly had a seizure that morning. While
staff communicated these concerns to the nurse,
his preferences and choices were not informally
offered or encouraged. He was observed initially
to be lethargic and sitting in his wheelchair
positioned in front of the TV for an extended
period of time and then observed to be offered stickers and paper which he did not show interest
in. Further he was offered a meal that did not
include any of his preferred foods. At
approximately 8:45 a.m., DSP #1 took individual
#1's meal back into the kitchen. Individual #1 was
not given extended time to participate in the meal.
III. Interviews
1. DSP #1 was interviewed at approximately 8:37
a.m. She stated individual #1 could have finger
foods in strips. She stated since an apple was a
finger food, it did not need to be chopped into ½""
x ½"" x ½"" pieces. Although the DSP stated the
apple did not need to be chopped, her statement
was in direct conflict with the individual's
aspiration protocol which identified apples as a
hard fruit that needed to be cut into chopped
pieces.
2. The senior area director (SAD), area director
(AD) and registered dietitian (RD) were
interviewed on 1/23/23 at 1:30 p.m. The RD
stated the recommendation for the finger foods
was from the speech language therapist (SLP).
She acknowledged that fruits were not individual
#1's favorite food so she was surprised this was
something staff provided. The RD acknowledged
staff most likely determined an apple to be a
finger food based on a normal texture, but agreed
it was a hard texture. The SAD stated they would
reach out to the SLP to determine what was
appropriate.
3. The SLP was interviewed on 1/24/23 at 12:04
p.m. She confirmed the apple should have been
chopped and they do not train that firm foods are
appropriate for finger foods. She acknowledged
the need for staff to be re-trained on individual #1's diet and what textures were appropriate for
finger foods."

interview, the facility failed to ensure physician
prescribed adaptive eating equipment was
provided correctly for one (#1) of one sample
individuals.
Findings include:
I. Record review 1. Record review for individual #1 beginning
3/6/2023 revealed a diet order dated 2/21/2023.
The diet order read ""Adaptive Equipment: Lidded
cup, short silicone straw, weighted build up spoon
as tolerated"".
2. Further record review revealed an annual
nutritional services assessment dated 5/10/2022.
The assessment read in part ""Has tremors with
feeding himself and uses adaptive utensils of
weighted built-up spoon, lidded cup with short
silicone straw, needs full assistance and support
with eating as needed with tremors but will not
always allow staff to help him"".
II. Observation
An observation of the home was conducted on
3/6/2023 from approximately 4:45 p.m. until 6:10
p.m. Direct care professional (DSP) #1, DSP #2,
lead DSP, program manager (PM), and qualified
intellectual disabilities professional (QIDP) were
present during the observation. Observations
revealed staff members did not provide the
correct adaptive equipment for individual #1.
At approximately 5:57 p.m. DSP #2 served
individual #1 dinner of chicken strips, rice and
peas. He was given a lidded cup with a short
silicone straw and a regular spoon. Individual #1
did not attempt to use his spoon, but instead used
his fingers.
III. Interviews
1. The PM was interviewed during the home
observation at approximately 6:01 p.m. She
stated individual #1 did not require an adaptive
spoon to eat with. She stated that he did not normally use a spoon and preferred to eat with
his fingers.
2. The RN was interviewed on 3/7/2023 at 11:30
a.m. The RN stated individual #1 preferred finger
foods and would often refuse to use his adaptive
spoon, but the weighted built up spoon should
always be offered by staff. She stated if even if
individual #1 refused the spoon and chose to eat
his meal with his fingers or with staff assistance, it
should have been offered. The RN acknowledged
the PM should have been aware individual #1
required a weighted built up spoon"

interviews, the facility failed to provide two (#2
and #3) of three sample individuals, a continuous
and consistent treatment program that consisted
of formal and informal training opportunities to
ensure the individual's needs were addressed
formally and informally across all relevant settings
by encouraging, reinforcing and facilitating the
acquisition of daily living skills, greater
independence, and choice. Specifically, staff did
not utilize formal or informal learning
opportunities to implement active treatment
training programs or to support the individual's
needs or preferences as identified in the
individual program plan.
This deficiency was cited previously during a
federal certification survey on 1/25/23, and based on the findings below, the facility has not
maintained compliance with this regulatory
requirement.
Findings include:
I. Observation
An observation of the home was conducted on
3/6/2023 from approximately 4:45 p.m. until 6:10
p.m. Direct care professional (DSP) #1, DSP #2,
lead DSP and the program manager (PM) were
present upon arrival. Observations revealed staff
members did not implement opportunities for
learning or interact with individuals based on their
documented preferences to provide the
individuals with formal and informal opportunities
for active treatment.
Upon arrival individual #3 was observed sitting at
the dining room table watching videos on her
IPad and individual #2 was observed laying in bed
watching TV with DSP #1 sitting in a chair next to
her bed. At approximately 4:55 p.m., Individual #2
came out from her bedroom and sat in a chair at
the dining table. The lead DSP was at the table
with two other individuals preparing a painting
craft. The lead DSP asked individual #2 if she
wanted to paint and individual #2 shook her head
""no"". Individual #2 stood up from the table and
went back to her room followed by DSP #1. At
approximately 5:02 p.m., the lead DSP got a
piece of paper, a tray of paint and cotton balls out
for individual #3 to paint with. Individual #3 did not
participate in the activity, but instead continued to
watch her animal video on the IPad. The lead
DSP asked individual #3 if she would like to
watch another video, to which individual #3
responded ""yes"". The lead DSP started a new video on the IPad and said to individual #3, say
""grizzly bear"" and individual #3 responded ""bear""
and was given verbal praise by the lead DSP.
The PM sat next to individual #3 when the video
was finished and started to play a piano
application on the IPad with her. Individual #3
continued to sit at the table and play on her IPad
for 20 minutes. At approximately 5:24 p.m.
individual #3 ' s IPad's battery died. Staff plugged
it in and offered her a book to read.
At approximately 5:27 p.m, individual #2 came
out to the dining area momentarily, then took
DSP #1 by the hand and led her back to the
bedroom.
At approximately 5:32 p.m., DSP #2 asked
individual #3 if she wanted milk or water with her
dinner and she responded ""milk"". DSP #2 stated
he could get that for her. The PM walked toward
the cabinets next to the kitchen and said to
individual #3, ""come here, I need your help"".
Individual #3 got up from the table and walked to
the cabinet. The PM got out four clothing
protectors and asked individual #3 to take them
to the dining room table. Individual #3 said ""no""
and sat back down at the table. Staff made no
other attempts to include individual #3 in meal
preparation or setting the table as recommended
in her IPP.
At approximately 5:38 p.m, individual #2 came
out of her bedroom and the lead DSP said, ""let's
put your clothing protector on"". Individual #2 sat
at the table and the PM put the clothing protector
on her. Other individuals living in the home were

II. Record review
A. Individual #2
Record review for individual #2 beginning
03/06/2023 revealed an IPP dated 10/25/2022.
The speech language pathologist (SLP)
assessment recommended the staff to encourage
individual #2's participation with peers and to
frequently initiate conversation with her. The IPP
continued to read, encourage social activities
such as playing a game, watching tv, or listening
to music with others, and explore a wide variety of
activities for recreation and cognitive stimulation.The SLP further recommended staff
to encourage use of forms augmentative and
alternative device (AAC) such as a picture choice
board to increase expressive communication.
The IPP read, staff were to encourage the use of
the AAC device by providing continual access,
maximal modeling and verbal prompting for
individual #2 to use for requests. Although, the
IPP documented individual #2 should be
encouraged to use her communication device
and participate in various activities, per the
observations on 3/6/23 staff did not offer the
device or provide stimulating activities.
Further review of the IPP revealed an occupation
therapy (OT) assessment dated 10/25/2022. The
OT assessment documented the individual could
participate in basic activities of daily living (ADL)
tasks such as self dressing, self-feeding, and
grooming tasks with verbal prompting. The OT
assessment further read, with prompts, individual
#2 could bring her dishes to the sink, sweep the
floor, complete simple kitchen tasks and do other
simple household tasks such as wiping the table.
The assessment read individual #2 appeared to
find ""meaning, purpose, and enjoyment"" in
completing ADL tasks and she would continue to
benefit from opportunities to complete these
tasks at home and at day programming. It further
read ""Every attempt should be made of staff to
involve her in ADLs such as washing tables,
clearing tables, putting away groceries, changing
her own TV channels, making her own meals and
drinks"". The OT made recommendations
including, that individual #2 should continue to
participate in 3 - 4 household chores/tasks with
staff supervision per day for exercise and
meaningful occupation, including put towels
away, put dishes in dishwasher, clearing tables including placemats, clean mirror, putting away
groceries, making her own meal and drinks,
clearing her dishes, cleaning windows etc., to
provide her with meaningful occupational and
functional activities. The OT recommendations
further read [the facility] may want to consider
setting up an activity calendar for the client to
provide routine and prevent restlessness during
downtimes in the house, including chores,
coloring time, game time, and TV time. She
should be encouraged to drink her tea outside on
nice days or at least in the common area.
Possibly play Michael Jackson Music to
encourage her to come out of her room for a
dance party at the same time each day. To
encourage individual #2 to be out of her room as
much as possible. The OT wrote, ""Staff should
encourage [individual #2] regular participation in
safe, functional activities including matching
games and melting beads, painting nails and
group activities while at the house instead of
sitting in bed watching TV for hours"". Per the
observations of individual #2 on 3/6/2023,
individual #2 was not observed to be encouraged
to come out of her room to participate in any
preferred or functional activities. Rather she was
observed coming out of her room twice with
minimal engagement from staff encouraging her
to participate in meaningful activities. During the
observation, she was not offered formal or
informal opportunities to participate in any of the
identified household tasks recommended in her
IPP, including helping in the kitchen, such as
assisting with meal preparation, setting the table,
or obtaining her own drink for dinner. During the
observation, she seemed eager to be in the
kitchen, but was told by staff to ""sit down"" multiple
times. B. Individual #3
Record review for individual #3 beginning on
1/23/2023 revealed an IPP dated 10/6/2022. The
IPP for individual #3 read: ""I really enjoy
interacting with others and am eager to take part
in what is going on around me"". The IPP
continued to read ""[Individual #3] needs
supervision to serve her food, prepare meals, and
plan meals. [Individual #3] enjoys participating in
meal preparation, setting/clearing the dining
table, and pouring her own drinks and will
complete these tasks with verbal prompts."" The
occupational therapist (OT) assessment within
the IPP recommended individual #3 continue to
improve on household activities including
cleaning the table, loading the dishwasher,
making her own simple meals, helping in the
kitchen with tasks such as pouring, mixing, using
the microwave with cues, taking out and putting
away items and setting placemats on the table.
During observations on 3/6/2023, individual #3
was only offered one opportunity to assist with
getting clothing protectors for dinner. She was not
offered any further formal or informal
opportunities to participate in any of the identified
household tasks including helping in the kitchen
or setting the table.
III. Interviews
1. The PM was interviewed on 3/6/2023 at
approximately 6:05 p.m. She stated she
attempted to get individual #3 to engage in active
treatment by taking the clothing protectors to the
table. She confirmed she did not make further
attempts to engage individual #3 in the meal
preparation or table setting process and stated
individual #3 was very tired that evening. The PM
stated active treatment for individual #2 was very dependent on her mood. She acknowledged staff
did not make the effort to involve individual #2 in
the meal preparation process.
2. The registered nurse (RN), area director (AD)
and QIDP were interviewed on 3/7/2023 at 11:30
a.m. The RN stated both individual #2 and #3
could have washed their hands with verbal
prompting either in the bathroom or
independently with a sanitizing wipe. The QIDP
stated she had been working with staff to involve
individuals with meal preparation and setting and
clearing the table. She stated in her observations
she often saw the individual ' s clearing their
plates and putting them in the dishwasher, but
couldn ' t confirm if she observed assistance with
meal preparation. The nurse acknowledged
individual #2 and #3 were capable of assisting
with meal preparation, especially setting the table
and getting their own drinks. The AD
acknowledged they needed to provide more
training for staff on expectations for active
treatment."

egress. Upon interview, the DCS confirmed the
finding and stated that it was changed to a
two-action lock to prevent a patient from
unlocking the door. failed to maintain the doors. This was evidenced
by an egress door requiring two actions to open.
This affected six of six clients and could result in
the delay of evacuation and protection from a fire.
